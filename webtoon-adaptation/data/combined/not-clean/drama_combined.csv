And, even though he didn't disappoint neither in his romantic scenes, nor in the action scenes, the story had some major plot holes that were never properly explained. The story, as it is, was interesting, as the main idea behind it was kind of original and well executed. However, the drama was kind of boring at some points. The performances, moreover, were really good from all the actors and actresses and the soundtrack was phenomenal. So, 7 out of 10.   Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Cancel"

I appreciated that the characters were dealing with very real life issues like finding a job, being motivated, etc, and some subtle humor was actually decent.As expected for a short web drama though, it didn't get to explore these things in depth as much as I wished it did, and the ending felt very bubblegum as everything just suddenly started going right.The more action-packed plotline was also a nice surprise  it's rare that web dramas try to explore a story that needs so much backstory. Sadly though I felt like the resolution was very deus ex machina, and it had no lead-in or sufficient explanation.I also really didn't like the side characters, and maybe part of it is just that there were way too many, and they all seemed to be dealing with the same issue of not knowing what you want to do in life.

Heres the thing - I liked the show when it started airing. I knew few people thought this type of plot might not work out with a drama format, but I was still full of hope. At some point, though, I had to admit they were right and I was wrong.This show should be 12 episodes long at best. Preferable 6 to 10. It should focus on exactly 3 plotlines: Da Jung and Dae Young, Dae Young and his kids, and Da Jungs job/dream. They should fill the episodes with school drama, as a lot of interactions were happening there. You can even keep the bullying and teen romance. But why, oh why do we need a love triangle? Why do we need a 2nd couple/romance? Why do we need all the scenes and interactions between Deok Jin and Ae Rin? Why do we need that Il Kwon mess? Or what was the point of this mystery photographer guy? There is so much going on in this show, and yet it feels like nothing is happening. All the most memorable moments that were truly meaningful were the family interactions. We do not need that many filler plots.The last two episodes were some whole new level of cliche and stereotypes. When you have 2 cars of doom for the price of one, you know you've hit the jackpot. The back story about Ji Hoon's brother being connected to Dae Young was unnecessary and presented in the worst possible way. Such an emotional scene and yet, I could not stop laughing when the 2nd car came out of nowhere.I don't even want to talk about the last minute ""I'm breaking up with you for your own good"" plot, because that trope just needs to die, or at least take a few years break from appearing on screen.The highlights? All the scenes between Dae Young and his kids, both in the past and present. The slow realization he had about mistakes he made, the gradual learning that Dae Young actually cared a lot for Shi Ah and Shi Woo. These are the scenes I will remember after the show ends, and these are the ones that moved my heart the most. These were the gems that made me cry so many times, and if the show focused more on the actually important parts (relationships between main characters), chances are it might have gotten a 10 out of me.For the acting, Lee Do Hyun aced the role. There are quite a few shows with the younger actor playing an older character after body switch, but none of the actors were as believable as Do Hyun. I trust this guy with my life. What do I see? Bright future ahead of him. His talent will lead him to some great roles and amazing projects.Overall, the acting was on point. The emotional scenes were emotional, happy and funny scenes were just that: happy and funny. No areas of complaint here. Some people might dislike a few overacting moments from Lee Mi Do, Kim Kang Hyun and Kim Yoo Ri, but it was clearly a stylistic choice that has nothing to do with the acting skills of the actors themselves.Usually I dont pay that much attention to the soundtrack, unless its truly outstanding. Here, I liked quite a few songs, especially Sohyangs Hello, which truly elevated the emotional scenes to a new level. Not to mention Sondia, who became one of my favorite ost singers, with an amazingly sweet and warm voice.Overall, nice show, but skippable. I stayed for the parents and kids relationship and Lee Do Hyuns acting. Even though I am massively disappointed by the obvious ending and last two episodes, the scenes between the family still made me tear up a bit and it shows how amazing this drama could have been if it was not for the unnecessary sub-plots."

On one hand the drama has fairly little emotional impact, there is no angst whatsoever, but the romances are also not exactly overflowing with emotional charge either. There is not much plot, but it meanders in strange directions. It's fantastic that the love triangle is so tame & easily resolved, but at the same time Anthony's character is just a waste of screen time, he is not annoying, just boring. Also the whole setting has infinite untapped makjang potential, certainly it's awesome that the writer did not go in that direction, but when I realized that the two male leads are stepbrothers, I could not help, but roll my eyes.  Also the way the ML kept telling the second ML that he is only only friends with FL repeatedly certainly caused me some minor frustrations. Despite the above I had a great time watching the drama. The sismances are up there with the very best & Han Ye Seul's calming energy is something rarely seen. Also the leads had great chemistry & looked adorable together. Most things in the drama are unusually wholesome and it's super nice how quickly and easily the scandals are dealt with. I cannot help, but feel that there were too many (interesting) characters to completely develop them in 32 half-episodes and the team has even wasted 2 full episodes worth of time on Anthony. Still gotta give them credit where credit is due. How often does one watch a relaxed romcom like this without it becoming draggy? The episodes certainly went by really fast, I reached the finale in a flash."

Have you ever started a drama that was so bad, like SO BAD that you want to drop it but at the same time its too mind boggling  stupid that you want to just watch it so you can laugh at how shit it was? Well welcome to 28 faces of the moon. I went looking for short dramas that I could watch on my commute to and from work. My bus ride is just under 20 mins so rather than getting upset to leave a normal episode of drama incomplete until I get home, I thought I would look into shorter dramas with 10-20 mins episodes. That is how I found this fiasco. I had previously watched Kiss Goblin which was 12x 10 minute episodes and a MILLION times more exciting/ interesting than this so I thought I was getting the same kind of quality here? HA HA HAThe irony is, the summary actually sounds interesting. I don't know who wrote this or produced it, but it definitely missed it's mark. It had the potential to be great. It failed HARD. The acting was bad. The storyline was bad. I wanted to drop it every step of the way but my pride forced me to finish it because I don't like leaving things incomplete. Overall, if I could rate this zero stars, I would but MDL doesn't have that option. I guess the 1 star is too generous for this mess but here you go writers1/10. Thanks for wasting my time."

It's always nice to find hidden gems, and I do think this webseries is one of those! While it is noticeable as it is in most webdramas that the producers of this show most likely didn't have a large budget, the directing and cinematography were appealing nonetheless. Each story was heartfelt, and I think this partially comes from the fact that to my limited knowledge,the cast members are just like the characters- attending a women's university with one another. They managed to cover sensitive and meaningful content in very brief amounts of time, while still giving us enjoyable and fluffy content. I particularly enjoyed the character of Juyeon and her plotline, as a lesbian. I enjoyed that rather than exclusively focusing on the internal struggles of being lesbian, it also showed that as partners we have normal issues like simple insecurities that aren't related to homophobia. Juyeon and her girlfriend as characters feel very real, and I think this shows how much effort the actresses put into it, especially after watching the behind the scenes videos. Overall, I think this is a nice collection of episodes that is heartwarming to watch as a woman.  I hope to see all of these young women acting in the future."

It was a slog just to finish it, even though it's pretty much just the length of a movie. Regardless of my initial appreciation of the chemistry between the three friends, I felt absolutely no connection with the female lead and saw no clear character motivations brought up among them. There is frighteningly little real conflict or stakes, which wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the complete lack of effective comedy throughout. Simply put: I didn't care. I didn't care about the characters, or their connections, or the unconvincing goal to return to the past (none of them seemed quite attached to it anyway). Whatever romance there was felt forced and undeveloped, and the female lead basically had no compelling character traits or motivations or flaws or... well, basically anything. I don't have too much against the acting or production, but I really just couldn't care less about any of it. I do not recommend this drama."

The most impressive part of this show is Jang Hyuk as Dr. Lee Yeong Oh. I've only seen him in Fated to Love You (which I LOVED), but he is completely unrecognizable compared to that role. His portrayal of a doctor who lacks empathy surprisingly tugged at my emotions. He was so good that it was impossible not to sympathize with his character. His approach to each case sometimes was reminiscent of the show ""House"", but I did find his character to be very unique. His performance alone would make me recommend this drama.

He is matched with Park So Dam as Gye Jin Sung. She was very cute, and played her role well, but I wasn't that impressed to be honest. In the beginning her character is written to be annoying, but that eventually turns into an awkwardness that is endearing. She also has pretty good chemistry with Jang Hyuk, and some really cute scenes, but there's no strong spark between them. Part of me wonders if a more mature actress would have made a better match for a strong character like Dr. Lee. It also may be too hard for some romance fans to root for the way the male lead uses Jin Sung. It didn't bother me, but I can see how some viewers may not like how gullible, and easy she is.

The supporting cast is also strong, especially the main hospital staff. Some of the ""bad guys"" are a little too clich for me, or not interesting enough to mention. Still, I think the cast is the strongest part of this show, they just didn't have a good enough story to support them.

The story was interesting at first, but I think it honestly became too complicated. The amount of betrayal, and corruption kept increasing, and I stopped being able to completely follow who was bad, and why. There was also a major personality change for one of the main characters which made that character less interesting to me. Then there was the complicated father son relationship, which was one of the most interesting parts of the show for me, but that story, and the romance story, were too often overshadowed by the hospital corruption plot which bored me. In spite my feelings about hospital dramas, I liked how the patient stories served to reveal new things about Dr. Lee, and I thought those stories were done well. I wish the overall drama focused more on that, and Dr. Lee, then maybe I would have liked it more.

The writers did do a good job of ending the show early without it feeling too rushed. I don't even think that having 2 extra episodes would have necessarily been any better. I prefer that a show be cut short rather than dragged out with nothing new to add. 

Overall I liked this show, but the start was much stronger than the finish. I don't really see myself watching it again, but I certainly don't regret watching. Like I said before, the main character is interesting enough that I would recommend watching this, but don't expect an epic romance, or an amazing thriller. In spite of my moderate review, I do agree that this show is underrated. I've seen much worse shows have much more popularity, so don't let the fact that it's unpopular fool you!"

Not gonna lie - I dropped the show after the first two episodes. They were fine, but did not catch my attention. Next week I felt like watching a rom-com, so I picked it up again, and from that moment I just enjoyed the silly ride it took me for. They really played into, and  at the same time broke all the cliches of kdrama rom-coms, and it was so much fun to watchThe story is something we have seen countless times - a fake relationship leads to a real one. Rich guy falls for a poor girl, yet few twists made it much more compelling and interesting. The female lead was not a damsel in distress -  she is competent, friendly, strong. The male lead was not a cold lead - he is a cute and soft potato. The father was not evil, rather funny and a bit childish. The best friend second lead deal is dealt with in a realistic manner. While the conflicts and issues between the main couple come from their different backgrounds, the second couples issues come from the differences of their personalities. Thanks to that we see a variety of interesting situations that kept me entertained. That said, there was one side plot situation that had quite an impact on the characters and their behavior, but then was gone and never mentioned, because the current plot progression did not need it anymore. I wished we had some kind of closure or explanation for it. The characters were all quite fun to follow. Except for the main cast that delivered a good performance, I want to talk about Seo Hye Won who played Jo Yoo Jung Young Seo's cousin. The girl was hilarious. Her random English lines with cartoonish subtitles on screen were some of the best scenes. She was extremely over the top, but it worked perfectly in the context of the show and overall tone. While I have no huge complaints about any of the performances, I was slightly disappointed with Kim Min Gue. His character lacked expression. I get that he was this well mannered, stoic, logic driven guy, but I was just not completely convinced by his delivery. Its an over the top romantic comedy - funny sounds, funny animations, funny subtitles on the screen, but all of that was rather fitting and elevated the scenes - be it making them more funny, cute, sometimes cringe. I mean, the whole show is cringe, but I appreciate how they embraced that. Sometimes its the way to go - dont take yourself too seriously, so people can enjoy it for what it is. I dont really have much to say about the soundtrack. All the songs were nice, cute and matching the drama, but the only one that truly caught my attention was Han Seung Yoons Whatever You Want. Overall, if you are in the mood for romance, I dont think you will find any better production from the past few years. It was cute, entertaining, did not have any over the top problematic plot lines, no random murder mystery we sometimes see in Korean rom-coms. Sometimes all one needs is good looking people falling in love with each other and all the cringe and sweet butterflies that come with it."

If you are one that do not like long drawn out secrets you may want to steer clear of this one because that is absolutely what you get. The writers did have  a way of adding more unknown secrets onto the secrets that most viewers were already aware of. This is one of the first times that I was a bit conflicted about writing a review. First, I would like to point out that the beginning of story itself is really good however the progress and/or development is not ideal. The beginning of this series focused on just that, the beginning. It follows our main characters from childhood and it really shines a light into who they are and how they met and how their bond and relationships developed over time. I find that the beginning of the series was absolutely adorable because it really show the innocence of the characters as youth. It showed their energy and ultimately their temperament as well. What stood out to me about the beginning of the series was that the reveal of community families to include the significance on a childs life experiences, security and growth. It was very hard moving and fun to watch.Once the cast transitioned from childhood to adulthood  things somewhat took a turn. The pacing stayed relatively the same. The actors changed, naturally as expected, but the warm and fuzzy we got from the youth experience  disappears/disintegrates/burns. The show takes a complete 360 turn it. It went from warm and fuzzy to crazy, shock and regrets. Thats right I said regret. After watching 60 episodes it becomes really apparent that the warm and fuzzy may not return until the very end. Sadly that very end is 60 episodes away. I have honestly watch so many episodes of this series and at this point I feel like I just wanna see how it ends. I am no longer invested in the middle pieces although I do plan to watch them. Im only watching to see how it ends at this point. If youre a lover of smooth sailing shows  like me, be warned. Although there is the mystery series drags it out a bit longer than Id like.To make matters worst, I waited 80 episodes for someone to just tell the truth about 1 thing. 1 THING!. The script is far out there.  I cant think of anyone on earth or in drama land that would actually allow themselves to be bullied and manipulated while knowing that they have the power to take down the bully or at least suppress them. On another note I cant think of any bully that will continue bullying knowing that the other people have the power to destroy them. Things just didnt make sense. Throughout the series, I continued to ask myself why are they letting the evil people get away it? And why dont they just tell the truth?These people held a secret for no apparent reason. No exaggeration! and they suffered needlessly.To top it all off we have a Guardian who has add the blue develop feelings for the very elementary person that he took in and raised from such a young age. Lets ignore the fact that he has an aged at all but the very thought of it seems quite uncomfortable. There is really no way to foil this. This guy was already an adult running a restaurant. He was most certainly not a teenager but probably in his 20s and she was a kid that looked about 8 years old. Am I still watching? More like skimming. Why? I would like to see the father and daughter connect. What I recommend it? Nope. Would I rewatch  it? Absolutely not.I have never, ever, ever watched a series that is as twisted as this. The power is twisted, the parental relationships are twisted, the friendships are twisted and if I have to be completely honest the adults are now appearing twisted as well. Reason has left this series.This is by far one of the worst dramas that I have ever watched. And I have watched a lot. First of all within this very very unusual drama you have a criminal who commits crime repeatedly and never get punished even though everyone knows that they were criminal. Everyone just casually pretends that nothing ever happened. Secondly we have an overly passive female lead who is suppose to be smart and strong but everything about her character reeks obliviousness, weakness and stupidity. Thirdly we have this weird out of the blue romantic interest of a child and guardian after years have passed. Not only was this awkward but it was also random and unsupported. Fourth, what shall I say we had that magic ending where we just assume that everyone lives happily ever after. No charges were pressed. Were friends with the murderer of our parents. We marry people that we dont really like and the end. This was just the strangest bunch of mess Ive ever seen.Titanic vibes, #CPR COULNT SAVE THIS!My brief synopsis of this series is as follows:. A good guy with a secret that could destroy the bad guy. Good guy holds the secret while being trampled by the bad guy. Bad guy knows that the good guy holds the secret that is crucial but still behaves wickedly. So ultimately what youll get while watching the series is the good guy having the power and ability to destroy the bad guy but instead of doing so they allow themselves to be bullied, lied on, controlled and manipulated for over half the series. At least up to 80. It was like watching someone hold a weapon but standing still to get beat up. WHY???????"

So, let me explain why I gave 8 points despite the drama's striking flaws.First thing I imagine when I read the title, is something flashy, magical and colorful. ""A Korean Odyssey"" definitely scores a hit in that category. Bright colors and places that make the world our characters are living in seem a little extraordinary. On the other hand (and my personal complaints) is the way those elements were executed. You might disagree with me and say that if the story itself is good, one can overlook failed CGI effects. Well, for me it's a really important factor because well done special effects can lift the quality and increase the impact of a certain moment a lot. You can probably imagine how I had to cringe whenever such a scene occurred - most of all in the finale. Despite that though! When it came down to the really important things which involved feelings, difficult decisions, realizations etc, you can say that the job was done neatly. They were even able to offer some killer minutes of emotional torture.Looking at the story, yes, the first half didn't feel like having a clear structure or a straight path to follow. It seemed uneven and tortuous. The second half though was more focused on progressing the actual story and preparing for the finale. As you can see, I liked the plot. The cast was great and fun to watch. Lee Seung Gi had great chemistry with all his co-actors, esp with Chae Seung Won (it's a matter of fact that these two are a match made in heaven - literally) and Oh Yeon Seo. I was worried about some awkward kisses between them and they were indeed a little coy at first, but in the end they did really, REALLY well. What else to like... I became a big fan of the supporting roles in this drama and the one who needs to be mentioned so much is Lee Se Young. In ""The Best Hit"" she didn't leave a lasting impression, rather the opposite. That's why I was even more surprised when I finally spotted her in this. Yes, it took me a while to even recognize her and if you haven't watched the drama yet, you will get what I'm talking about right then. Let me applaud to that girl, she was a real bombshell.My second favorite was/were Fairy Ha and Winter General. Two characters, two genders but one actor. Sung Hyuk was incredible. He pulled off these two totally different and yet so similar personalities, made both appear with their own aura and was able to touch my heart with their story. Lee Hong Ki aka PK. I enjoyed his character the more I saw of him. Just like all the other heavenly creatures he was flawed, self-centered and never left out an advantageous opportunity (even though he was interrupted most times). But he had his heart in the right place and defended that one friend he got impulsively - although not always with the most clever methods.My happiest moments while watching ""Hwayugi"" were whenever I noticed certain elements of other mangas. Yes, you did read right. It doesn't sound nice, I know. But believe me, it's not meant in a bad way. It's exactly the opposite because there were so many different things packed in this one drama, that they became a sweet additional ingredient. Some examples are Inuyusha, Kamisama Hajimemashita, Sailor Moon and Naruto. Feel free to search for other ones. It's definitely a fun side game. I mentioned ""striking flaws"" earlier and I already noted the most annoying things for me. If I were to add one more thing it would be the music. Don't get me wrong, the songs were a beautiful mood supporter. But whenever they changed scenes, they cut off the tune so brutally, that they ruined my special moments and gave me a hard time getting into the new scene.This being said... I don't know about others (although I saw that not everyone was satisfied and expectations were shattered cruelly), I for myself had a great time watching ""A Korean Odyssey"". I was not able to overlook its blunders, but they were not overwhelming enough either and didn't diminish my enjoyment. Call it guilty pleasure or whatever. I had a great time."

The second part of the drama focuses, on the other hand, on their adult lives and that's when the drama starts, with the main relationship being tested and sometimes skips that weren't handled smoothly. I guess the main problem that this drama faces is its short episodes. They try to have small cases per episodes, but the actual story can't be developed properly due to that. Another minus that appeared was the cliche of many situations that arose. From the old camera work to the cheesy romantic gestures, but, especially, to the female lead's reactions to everything that were beyond childish and ended up being annoying, the drama is just too predictable and not because its a remake. Come to think about it, the original was closer to the melodrama premises, with a focus on their adult life, family problems and more grown up drama. On the contrary, this one is more immature and gets boring easily. At least the side characters were interesting and added some entertainment here and there when it was needed. The performances were pretty good from everyone in the cast as well.So, overall, 3.5 out of 10."

Whilst the  revenge cliche was possibly the most intriguing of the show,  A Man  in a Veil didnt truly use this to either flesh-out nor deepen the characters, with  Tae Poong often feeling  more like a  stock male lead with little interest for viewers or emotional depth behind his actions. ( Apart from Eun Taks random screaming  matches and pained  facial expressions when it was necessary for the  plot). Arguably, Yu Jung did have a little more depth than Tae Poong,  due to her complicated feelings for both him  and the second male lead  Seo Jun ( Lee Shi Kang), her later tragedy and motivation towards getting back at her sister and a family revelation as well. On the other hand, considering the emotional and traumatic depth in reality towards this  tragic event which took place in the series, Yu Jung not mentioning this again after it was necessary for the  story felt both lacklustre and poorly- written in the grand scheme of character- writing. Ironically , one of the worst-written characters in the show must go towards Yu Ra as both an individual  and an antagonist . It was evident from the get-go that screenwriter  Lee Jung Dae wasnt attending to make Yu Ra a  sympathetic villain - shes inherently a selfish and despicable character who later becomes deluded by her own abilities to outwit others. On the other hand, its hard to really understand what makes Yu Ra actually tick or the actual motives behind her thoughts, apart from not wanting to  be in poverty and  survive. To make matters worse, we very rarely got to see Yu Ra as an actual human being. The several moments which could have offered genuine intrigue into Yu Ra as a character ( such as her past and later events) were entirely written-off to make Yu Ras schemes more and more unbelievably ridiculous by each episode. ( Counterpart to the other antagonistic character played by Kim Hee Jung as Joo Hwa Yeon.)This certainly leads the storyline to take on a dragging and lacklustre focus between the three primary storylines; Tae Poong and his revenge, Yu Ras attempt to climb-up the social ladder and the dirty secrets of their associates ( including Yu Jung and Yu Ras parents as well as Seo Juns mother and father). Whilst arguably each storyline did have some attraction in how they played out, before even the halfway point, the show began to draw itself too much away from the main protagonists own ventures into other characters lacklustre storylines, which took away many of the twists which were supposed to be  emotional and  shocking for viewers with little delivering impact for viewers . Consequently the plot inconsistencies of the show were beyond incoherent - CCTV cameras,  criminal  investigations  and actual forensics are nonexistent , the characters are ridiculously  dumb enough to make the same mistakes over and over in favour of  plot motivation and later relevant twists completely contradict earlier  statements made in the show.Perhaps it is due to the fact that the show is so detached from coherent plot line  , or, the fact that the stylists choices are so outdated ( including product placement) helps the show to seem older   , but, A Man In A Veil is a perfect example of a show more than  a decade  behind recent trends - the characters have no depth or actual intrigue for viewers , the storyline is filled to the brim with more and more ridiculous cliches, and even the ending felt a little lacklustre. ( In particular  after building more than  80 episodes of Tae Poong seeking revenge only to be  miraculously solved with little sense of conflict or poetic justice for our main lead . )Its fair to say that  A Man in a veil is a typical makjang- certainly not worth watching if youre looking for something deep, but so laughable, it keeps you watching to see what hare-brained scheme the scriptwriter tried to come up with next."

Its confusing and it feels like you are being sucked into someones memories, showing you just bits and pieces of what happened, but instead of feeling frustration, you just want to know more.The characters are quite unusual, but in a refreshing and realistic way. Every one of them has a unique perspective on life and can teach you a few important lessons. Watching them interact and see them conquer their fears, accepted failures and move on to happiness is quite therapeutic.All the characters have some kind of struggles they are facing, and all of them deal with them in a different way. We can relate to some and learn from others. Each presents a specific approach to life and striving for happiness.It shows how people deal differently with pain: some pretend to be strong, some crumble, others live in denial and some chase after the lost happiness even when it's impossible to get it back. In a surprisingly heartwarming way, it shows the various sides of depression that does not leave the viewer drained of life, but rather hopeful.The directing and editing has this dreamlike feel to it, which makes the drama even more appealing. Some might say it was too slow paced, too confusing, but for me it was pure perfection. Usually I dislike dramas that are this slow. I feel like they just try to be artistic for no reason. Somehow, the slower pace added a whole new level of charm that made me love A Piece Of Your Mind even more.Any flaws? The device itself. While I can accept its existence, how it was made cannot be explained no matter how far-fetched sci-fi approach you take. Did it bother me while watching? No, since the device itself was never the focus point of the plot. It was always about the people and their relationships and how they can affect each other, not the electronics that made the connection happen in the first place.Overall, its a healing story that will make you feel like you have dreamed it."

Do not get me wrong, it is important to be in touch with ones emotion and I am all for people crying. However this is just over done making me want to have a good talk withe her about how to re-direct those emotions. She also finds comfort in others misfortune... Yes she feels for them but also uses it to cheer herself up... my problems are not as bad as that guys so I should just put myself together... She is naive as **** and keeps getting doupet by the world... Do not get me wrong she does have her fun moments, sweet, caring to the point of obsession, but after seeing her cheer her up with others misfortune I felt that she was not that genuine after all... But I do like her at times she has a beautiful smile and does show an interesting personality from time to time... 2. Mr Playful Jerk on the outside, fluffy marshmallow on the inside... A kid who was never really loved and acts like a 2 year old who has not had their nap... immature but still the boy is very pretty and has the greatest character development of them all...  He is overall a  person that it is easy to open up to and feel comfortable with. 3. Mr arrogant  Icicle on the outside, mature cotton candy on the inside... A Super Physical therapist, mature, good looking and what many would think waaay out of number 1s league... is actually kind of awkward and falls for her kindness and says the words "" Should i give you some advice?"" over and over again without actually waiting for the other person to answer.

Content Warnings: self harm, harassment/bullying, slaps, held against will, trauma/grief, vomiting, another major content warning that happens off screen in the pastWhat I Liked- intro with the music and the animation/style of it- archery integration and Da Yeol's plotline related to it was well done- happy Tae Hyun told off his aunt but wanted to see more resolution- Da Yeol's actions in episode 6/standing up for himself- production value (but the too light make up and red eyeliner was not for me)Room For Improvement- struggled with their initial dynamic, it did get better though- they tried to cover too much plot and as a result there was not enough resolution (aunt? dad? did Tae Hyun try to work on himself/go to therapy???)- toilet humor and the comedy sound effects did not mesh well with the serious parts- time jumps scream lazy writing to me, it should have been shorter and then not have episode 7 or saved that for a second season, speaking of....- episode 7 was a huge letdown, these are 2 guys in their 20s, I think the production chickened out and catered to the minority of these idol actors' fans which was detrimental to the story/their characters, it felt so unrealistic that it took me out of the story- the production also modified (unfortunately) that beginning scene in the nurses office from the source material (it was exactly what Da Yeol thought it was), it also made the ""friend's"" actions in the series kind of head scratching- not clear how much time passed in the beginning episodes"

I started watching with a lot of interest, because the premise of ""life clocks"" was so interesting. I loved the idea of this tragic love story meets rom com, but once I got sucked into the story it was clear that it was turning into a mess of clichs. Still there was enough left to like, so I continued to watch with no regrets. A lot of that credit should go to the cast.I was at first suspicious about whether I'd like MiKa and Do Ha as a couple, since their chemistry isn't immediate. I know there are often big age gaps in dramas, but her childish behavior, and his stern maturity, initially felt like such a bad casting choice. Then, once Do Ha turned on the charm, I started to really like them together, and got very invested in their romantic dilemma (No spoilers, but I knew tears over them would be involved eventually). I think this is the first ""grown up"" role I've seen Lee Sung Kyung in, and definitely the most tragic, but her youthful fun personality kept her character from being too depressing to watch as she watches how much time people have left to live.  I was also very surprised by how much I liked Lee Sang Yoon as a leading man. He has a very low key seductive quality that I loved, and I felt like I could see all of his characters love, heartbreak, concern, and guilt, just in his eyes alone. My main, and only, criticism of MiKa... too much dang singing! Unfortunately a lot of this drama becomes about the making of a musical, which started to become extremely annoying. I get that performing is a huge part of who the character is, but I cringed every time I knew she would be singing a full song AGAIN. It's not that she can't sing, but she still sang too much, and none of the performances were epic enough to be repeated. The soundtrack is also pretty good, but because of all the songs from the musical being sung on repeat, I just wanted all the music muted after a while. I honestly wish that most of the scenes and characters revolving around the musical were cut, but maybe it would have worked better with just less. I also say this as a person who LOVES musicals. The rest of the cast was great, even if some of their characters were written to be clich, or pretty useless. I really did like everyone... mostly. MiKa's bff was awesome, her brother was cute, and her mom was irritating but also adorable, and I liked Do Ha's banter with his secretary, but there were 2 supporting characters in particular that I liked the most, maybe even more than the main characters. I'll start with my favorite KDrama actress Kim Hae Sook. She is always good, and this drama is no exception. I feel like her character's story touched me the most. She had so many moments that got me in the feels. I wish I got to see her with MiKa more than many of the other characters, especially Do Ha's family, since everyone but his Dad and half brother were completely forgettable.My absolute favorite character though is Im Se Mi and Bae Soo Bong. I know this may be an unpopular opinion, but I thought she was flawless. Her outfits were flawless too! Usually I cringe at the idea of a female character who's only there to ruin the main couple, but Soo Bong is that to the best extreme! There were 2 moments when I came very close to dropping this drama completely, and she kept me watching. Her character became definitely overly melodramatic, but it was much more entertaining than the repetitive mess that the rest of the story started to become, or the ex girlfriend who I forgot all about until typing this sentence.That leads me to my main issue with ""About Time"". Even though the basic idea of the story is good, the actual drama decides to fill the time with unnecessary filler stories (family rivalries that go nowhere, useless exes, showbiz drama involving a cute but completely ridiculous ""genius"" temperamental director...) and then resorts to clichs, and flashbacks. I would be lying if I said there weren't still moments that brought me to tears, or made me laugh, but when I finally made it to the final episode it was clear that there was no original thought put into how the story would end. I felt like the ending chosen was a total cop-out, and I even laughed inappropriately at one point. Sure, there is closure for the characters, which will satisfy some, but for me it didn't live up to this story's potential.Overall, I cannot say that this drama is worth the time. If you decide to watch, and feel the urge to hit fast forward, do it! That's the only way I would rewatch this. There are some good moments, and some thoughtful themes about truly enjoying life, and not taking anything for granted, but, If this drama had a life clock I would definitely cut a few hours from it."

Not enough brain power was used in writing the plot.Fantasy set in modern times should explore the unexplained, but never go against what we actually know and contradict the reality. When they dropped the ""I got resurrected in a new body, but my DNA stayed the same"" I was extremely close to dropping it again. Honestly, I did not think it could go any more illogical.Sadly, the lack of logic was a prominent part of the plot. Characters, depending on the given situation, turned either smart or dumb. The show used exactly the same plot lines over and over again. How many times can I watch Hee Jin's mom being kidnapped? Or Se Yun being in the same type of danger?The ridiculousness of the script made it entertaining though. There is one secret child, and then there is another... and third. Cross-dressing Cha Min DEAD BODY and putting a wig on it, so the killer can bring him back to life... And the weird plot twist in the end with god (?) showing up, just to give us that sweet forced happy ending.I'm sorry, but when Cha Min started disappearing Thanos style I laughed like crazy. How nice of the Abyss to start from the bottom to the top, so he had these few seconds to say goodbye. The rules of Abyss make no sense; that's the conclusion.Also, at some point I wanted to (_) after hearing all the ""Se Yun is not as pretty now, she looks average"" jokes and comments. It was laughable with how beautiful Park Bo Young is.So, did I like anything? Yes. I'd say the cast did an amazing job portraying the characters and the chemistry between the leads was truly great. The thing that caught my attention was how natural the skinship was.Overall, I kind of enjoyed the experience of watching, simply because my expectations were as low as possible.

Adamas isn't for everyone and I'm most likely included in that list. The show had a very promising start and suddenly started to drag it's heels at the beginning making it a hard watch. I was excited to see a dual role but by instantly separating the twins and shooting scenes separately for most of the show undid that excitement. It might as well have been played by 2 actors. The camera work that excited me at the very beginning of the series was no where to be found. The writer twin spent majority of his time roaming around the mansion repeatedly which I would just watch at 2x speed. At the time, I found the role of the prosecutor twin more exciting. But soon that too felt like it was heading nowhere.Most of the excitement starts around episode 9 onwards. By then a lot of the secrets about the mysterious Adamas are exposed. The people fighting the bad guys all seem to be helpless and powerless despite their status and connections. It is frustrating to see them failing so badly at times and you have to wonder why they have no result to show for all the work and manpower they've put in.There was a rare opportunity to wind everything in a positive and thrilling way but it was a disaster after disaster for the good guys. In fact, episode 14 may have been the best episode. The ending leaves you scratching your head and wondering what happened? The satisfaction that one might get from watching a crime drama is nowhere to be found here. Do some bad guys get punished? Yes. But it's so underwhelming. And one of the characters realises, ""truth holds no power"". This is the entire theme of Adamas.Acting and production is good quality but if the story telling fails to enthrall you, the hard work of the cast and team is meaningless.SMALL SPOILER:They tease an open-ending and if just makes you think, do I want to put up with that again in the second season? Probably not, in my opinion."

Ofc more could have been explored, but I am impressed with what I saw.  Korea, can we have more types of these shows with these types of characters?  this was a pretty good show. The show focuses on three teenagers experiencing different issues in life and figuring out how to get through them. My personal favorite story was Jaemins. The bits with the online class he was taking had me laughing. Not only was it relatable but I can totally picture a guy doing a no-fap challenge to get a girl he likes. Yu Ris story hit close to home with me because its kind of what Im going through currently in my life. Im sure a lot of girls out there are waiting for a genuine guy with good intentions to come their way but instead end up feeling disappointed and used. Ive yet to see the last episode but the ending to the first two stories are satisfactory. Im glad to have finally found a show with teens who have realistic issues that are relevant to their age because you dont see that much in the kdrama world. The acting is good too despite the no-name cast(except for Miyeon). All the actors involved seemed to genuinely portray teens in an approachable way, which was fantastic for the viewer.

David is once again up against Goliath. In his first life, the young prosecutor fails - and dies. But miraculously he gets a second chance. Eventually, in this second attempt he sophisticatedly works on a supportive network. David no longer fights alone. ""Again My Life"" is part of a kind of law-and-order series invasion that swept over the KDrama world in 2022. The country seems to be crying out for justice. There is obviously a growing urge for real justice and effective punishment for the backroom masterminds, who are holding the true strings of power. A yearning for an end to eternal corruption. At the same time, there is great frustration that it seems so extremely difficult, almost impossible, to truly say goodbye to the old autocratic structures. There are laws, but they still don't seem to equally apply to everyone. For some time already, KDrama creatives (and their sources like webtoons etc.) have been fervently exploring the possibilities for a new horizon. In 2022, however, we see an unprecedented abundance, almost a climax, on a desperate path of effectively and/or morally defying the machinations of the powerful and the injustices and loopholes within the practiced legal/societal system. E. g. ""Military Prosecutor Doberman"", ""Juvenile Justice"", ""Why Her"", ""Insider"", ""Doctor Lawyer"", ""Law Cafe"", ""The Empire"", ""May it Please the Court"", ""One Dollar Layer"" and even ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo"" mercilessly bombard the audience with the same basic structural problems over and over again. In doing so, in their own individual way they juggle with the possibilities, opportunities and limitations that the legal system and the rule of law have to offer. And so does ""Again my Life"". ""Again my Life"" is one of those productions that, bottom-line, choose a rather sobering, almost pessimistic perspective. A pessimistic tone might come from the fact that the protagonist actually needs a magical impetus to even get a minimum chance to clean up the ailing, corrupt and mendacious system: with a second life. Time is practically turned back and he gets the opportunity to live once more - to make it better with the advantage of his knowledge about connections and context. Pessimistic might also be the fact that in the end the outlook is a questionable one. The audience may be satisfied in many respects, yet the basic problem cant be thoroughly resolved - which I would think is pretty close to reality. The audience is mercilessly confronted with the question: is real democracy an illusion? Is democracy just a modern marketing gimmick that secretly hides the old concept of autocracy that has been tried and tested on the peninsula for centuries? A new, beautified skin for the old wine?Is the message therefore a pessimistic one? Almost, but then no. Because even if it feels (and really) requires rather superhuman efforts (or circumstances) to counter the old autocratic domination effectively, it can individually still succeed. The evil resides in each individual human being - in our seductibility and venality. Everyone has to face that. Again and again. It's not something that's rooted in the system, but in people. People fill community with life. Everyone contributes to it. This is partake and participation. However, this is only possible with mature, responsible, self-responsible, upright citizens who cannot be bought - and thus degraded to bowed lackeys. Autocrats (= powerful private individuals within the given democratic framework conditions) need appropriate lackeys who give them power by supporting them in undermining the existing legal system. Therefore: what may come across as a pessimistic message at second glance turns out to be a rousing warning finger: Be vigilant! Stay alert! Do not give up! Take your chance, every day! Prove to yourself that you are a sincere citizen: Self-determined. Independent. Responsible. This is the only way, democracy and the rule of law can actually work. Otherwise, we agree with those self-proclaimed autocrats - and then we don't have a right to grumble and complain... Against this background, ""Again my Life"" offers a compelling, exciting story and at the same time a vivid lesson in 'responsible citizens versus corrupt lackeys'."

It almost came out of nowhere and I was expecting a vastly different drama from the premise. But what I got was so much better and before I knew it I was completely hooked. I waited for each episode with great anticipation, which is always a very nice feeling.It is short for a kdrama (only 12 episodes). But still manages to tell a good, well-fleshed-out story. It is all about friendship and fighting the ghosts in your life, together or alone. No matter in what shapes as sizes they come.There is a scene at the beginning of the drama where Song Ji Won tells the other girls that she sees ghosts. And there is a ghost living in the closet by the door. All the girls ghost interpret in their own way and it gives the show a bit of a gloomy atmosphere.It was not always easy to watch , since it became a lot gloomier and darker than I expected it to be. And at times I did feel like it was trying to hard to be that way. But it was still always grounded in reality. And there are also many light and funny moments between the gloomy bits. As well as very heartwarming moment between girls, and other characters in their lives. I felt like the drama did manage to strike a good balance between all these different moods.The relationship between the girls is so well done. It felt real. they care so much for each other. Even if they all come from different places and all have vastly different personalities and different problems to deal with. And they mesh very well together, most of the time. But they also argue a lot. Each of them gets their own part to tell their story. Although some girls get a heavier history than others and are therefore get bigger story line. Which is something the production could have balanced better.You can yourself a bit in every one of these girls. Or at least empathise for them. But at they can annoy you as well at the same time. Just like real friend do. None of them were one-dimensional in any way, since they all got a time to explain their side of the story. I felt for these characters and I loved them all. I could put myself in their shoes. Although I had never experienced most of the things they were experiencing.The girls were the center of the story and nothing else. Not even the romance, like I thought it would be at first. Since I thought it was about a youth drama all about campus-romance. But instead I got something much better. The romance was a big part of the show, but the drama was not about finding a boyfriend.The romance was both sweet and cute, and sometimes a little sad. But it isnt the centre of things. The drama is, for me at least, mainly about friendship and growing as a person. But it manages to be really good a mix of all of these things.Its rare to get a kdrama like this one, where we get to follow five young women and their lives. And this is entirely about them. The rest is just extra. It was refreshing. I felt like this show was made ??by women (although the director is a male), about women, for women."

Cool freshness, fashion, speed, one or the other rivalry as well as all categories of human manners, even the lowest, underline the handpicked lifestyle ambience. This all guarantees a lot of fun, seriously...The topic hits the South Korean nerve of the time. The nerve of women in particular, I should add. What may appear to Western eyes as an entertaining office drama with catfights has a completely different explosiveness in the eyes of Asian, especially South Korean viewers: The deeply hidden, rousing topic of the time, which affects everyone, is population decline. The critical nerve bubbling on the surface revolves around sexism and misogyny. The incumbent President Yoon proclaimed that these topics could be shut into history books, but ""Agency"" gives him the lie, right on. The KDrama clearly demonstrates how up-to-date it is. More than one South Korean woman in this story, no matter what position  down to the generation of the mothers of those mothers in the series - will find themselves here. And more than one man as well...It is pleasing to see how razor-sharp and competent the female protagonist proves herself in this man's world. Also pleasantly refreshing side effect here and there: alternative model approaches for female vs. male management styles. And then there is the extravagantly privileged and insolent Jaebeol of the youngest generation who eventually is inspired to break free from her heavy chains of family-clan expectations. Besides their punching power, both lead ladies are palpable, too. Watching the series is a pleasure, even if the topics touched on may also arouse rather different feelings as well...

And while we are at it, ""Agency"" is innocently, smilingly, prettily and yet cleverly and valiantly placing a feminism-sting, too. ---------------------------------------------SIDE NOTE: --- Misogyny and population decline in South Korean society ---Without women it wont do. But South Korean President Yoon has now officially messed with them. There was an enormous wave of protests when he announced that he wanted to abolish the ministry, which had been set up around 20 years ago to support women against sexual assaults and for equal rights, arguing the issue was no longer an issue. Immediately, around 800 organizations formed and stood up. President Yoon, who is promoted and sponsored by a strong conservative, patriarchal current, has blown a hornet's nest. His world  that of macho men  is obviously different from that of contemporary South Korean women.It is a given fact, that misogyny in South Korea characterizes everyday life throughout all classes. Neither an entrenched, male-dominated business world from the bottom up to the boardrooms, nor professional disadvantage and discrimination of women in the workplace, belong to history yet. In the contrary, recently it has even been fuelled by the election of the current President Yoon. Fortunately, there are opposing movements and criticism. The KDrama ""Agency"" uses a socially critical magnifying glass here. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go, although a drastic reflection is desperately needed, in order to be redirect economic development towards a positive light.The current demographic trend is closely linked to the economic and social situation, which is shaped by antiquated patriarchal beliefs. Those old (apparently always happy to be taken off the socio-cultural shelf, dusted off, polished to a high gloss and then put back again) convictions stand in stark contradiction to the high pace of the high-tech modernity of everyday life in South Korea. This tense paradox is already having a negative impact (not just on women's attitudes towards life, but also) on the countrys economy. The official statistics on population development from August 2022 show declining numbers for the first time. Actually, the country's birth rate is the lowest in the world. There is no trend reversal in sight. The population will continue to shrink. And that is already and will even more so affect the economy. The proportion of women in the working population (at 55.1 percent) could certainly be increased. Although South Korean women are very well educated on average, only a little more than half of them actually bring their skills into business life. Among men, on the other hand, 73.7 percent are employed. This is due not least to the misogynist attitude in all areas. The difference in pay between women and men is estimated at 31.1 percent. Nowhere else in the 38 OECD countries is it THAT bad. Added to this is the disadvantage on the career path. Work-life balance is in its infancy, because the motto is: woman to the stove. Executive suites are for men only. Women are rarely seen here. And if so, then often only for ornament or to fill the image of an empty marketing shell (similar to ""Agency"").It's high time that the many misogynists among South Korean men (including their president) arrived in the present. In the long run, a trend reversal can only succeed jointly  at eye level."

That's how much I loved Alchemy Of Souls. I can tell you that it does not disappoint.The original plot summary was confusing so I would describe it as follows. In a fictional country of Daeho, there are mages calpable of manipulating the environment around them. Jang Uk is one who has been forbidden by his father to learn spells. He has been seeking a master who is willing to teach him but none are willing to disobey his father's wishes. Naksu is a powerful female assassin. Due to a spell called the alchemy of souls she switches bodies in an attempt to escape harm. Fate brings Naksu and Jang Uk together. Will she take him on as her pupil?The Alchemy Of Souls starts with a bang. The intro of Naksu and her skills is depicted in a breath taking manner. We are also introduced to the magic and power of the mages and their wondrous world.The story also builds upon the cards Jang Uk has been dealt with and his character.The bonding of Naksu as Mudeok (as she is known after switching bodies) and Jang Uk is the heart of this series. Their firey personalities bring moments of comedy and delight.We are also introduced to a second lead, Seo Yul, another powerful mage and friend of Jang Uk. He gives such sweet vibes but he will not hesitate to kill an enemy with a swing of his swords.The crown prince Go Won has one of the best character developments on this show. He is not what you may expect from a character in dramas usually which is why it makes it so wonderful seeing him.Some of the other amazing characters are Master Lee who adds a new dimension to the story, Maidservant Kim who brings a loving touch to the story and  the two along Park Jin bring a lot of the lighter and comedic moments to life.The entire casting has been praise-worthy with each character bringing the mystery, intrigue and excitement to the show.

We so did. And do you know what? S2 actually had a promising start. For what its worth, I thought Go Young Jung did a good job with bringing forward a new Naksu who had retained her innocence and wasnt tainted by all the misery. Jung so Min was a tough act to follow and GYJ did it seamlessly, quickly making us like this cute, sweet, resilient and silently strong woman in love, atleast for a short while.The usual amnesia, cold man/warm woman angst worked well enough as a guilty pleasure watch in the first, say, three episodes but then it got real old real fast and you quickly realise:YOU DONT WANT A CUTE, SWEET, RESILIENT AND SILENTLY STRONG WOMAN IN LOVE ANY MORE.No. You want Naksu back. Its absolutely ridiculous how Hong sisters created this idea of a damaged female assassin with baggage who can be selfish, tough, vulnerable, ruthless and is actually a multi layered character and then spent a season and a half forcing her into the role of a ditzy damsel in distress, constantly in need of saving by oh so strong men.While her male leads are getting these magnificent and badass grand entrances where they fight a hundred enemies in one go, what does the supposedly powerful female assassin get? A good amount of screen time where she faints, gets hot flashes or enjoys her favourite past time: crying helplessly.The plot in season 2 is nothing to sing home about. Its just Jang Uk running circles around the elephant in the room: the identity of Naksu who is traipsing right under his nose.They just drag and drag and drag that one plot line that by the last episode you really just dont care at all. The grand reveal is also extremely lacklustre and anti-climatic. Its like the Hong sisters are making shit up as they go and wing-ing it like their lives depend on it. The cheap attempts at contrived emotion with the fake deaths, sentimental music and dumb cliffhangers is the height of poor writing. While the Crown Prince does bring in the comedy and there are a few adorable bromance moments; they are nearly not enough to carry the show on for ten episodes.I am honestly so offended with the way they dangled the possibility of Naksu owning her skills and showing every one whos boss in front of me like a carrot and forced me to watch till the end but all I really got was unnecessary pining, a grade school romance, a heroine whose entire purpose is solely to build the hero up and then make herself scarce  and Hong sisters displaying how deeply they are entrenched in their own internalised misogyny. Theres no other way to say it because God forbid, the female lead actually saves the day in even one episode. Blasphemy! Dont even get me started on the other potentially powerful female character in the drama Jin Bu Yeon who was reduced to little more than an after thought only getting five minutes of mentionable screen time. So really, going in this show, please dont expect an actual plot, story line or any sort of meaningful character development because youll end up having your intelligence insulted.Instead, check it out only if you want a mindless watch that serves as a guilty pleasure and is more or less fan fiction in TV form. Oh and there are some steamy kisses. Hong sisters really thought theyll throw in some skin ship as a band aid over the bleeding, torched, infected and full of pus wound that was season 2s plot.Make of that what you will. Enjoy."

As I was watching it, I thought it had been based on a manga. It gave me that feeling of being out of proportion, fantastically real. Even the main protagonists names tell a story: Summer, a boy, and Winter a girl.Winter used to be called Alice and was a student of a particularly twisted school in England training children to become assassins. One day she decides to escape and severely injures the school principal, a psycho of the tallest order. She escapes to Korea and hides in Summer's school. He is a loony kind of a boy, suffering from a trauma, put on suicide watch and constantly asking to be beaten up in order to feel alive. The principal activates his criminal network in order to find Alice. And when he does, all hell breaks loose!You have everything in this short drama, so much so, I wished it were longer. Just read the tags. What I liked the most was the black humour in this. Every character in this drama is seriously twisted, the world they live in is a genuine nightmare. And Summer is the king of this world. He is deadpan, untouchable in his school. He is so calm that he scares the local bullies. And he finds a soulmate in Winter, who is his opposite, trying to be normal. He does not care about being normal, he is only looking for a reason to live in this cutthroat world. Winter gives him that reason. What is this about? Only gratuitous violence? Not necessarily. In a twisted, strange way it tells you a version of ""nature or nurture"". Can you be taught to be a killer or do you need an incentive to kill? Alice was raised to be a killer but could not kill until her soulmate was killed (or she thought so!). Both of them, ultimately, do not think twice and kill in order to protect each other.The actors are all amazing but especially the one playing Summer, Song Geon Hee. He managed to express Summer's feelings and states of mind through a single almost invariable wide smile: that could be goofy and cute quickly becoming  crazy and ending up surprised all within a minute! Amazing! Give this guy more lead roles!This is not an easy drama to watch: it is very bloody and violent but everything, at the same time, is so exaggerated. Cinematography goes well with this: it is gray, dark almost monochrome.Ultimate Weapon Alice is not for everyone: the violence, the ugliness, the violence, the insanity and the violence is the main theme here!"

It not new in the least but it is interesting enough to make you want to watch and find out what is going to happen and why things are happening the way they are. So that mystery element is a good driving point. I won't claim it to be the best show but for 10 min episodes, it's a fun watch. It's the length of a movie.If you are a huge horror fan, then you might not enjoy the series as the scary parts are mild. Then again it might be worth giving a shot."

I'm not sure I understand what the show was trying to say or accomplish. Personally, I think they should've cut the whole 2023 storyline and kept the focus on the kids. I didn't hate the 2023 storyline, but it was distracting. Also I strongly feel that they ruined Go Yoo's character in the future because they wanted to keep the audience guessing on which boy it was. I also think they should've cut Han So Yeon's character. She only added conflict to the story, which is usually a good thing, but in this case it was more frustrating than anything else because I loved the relationship between Go Yoo and Joon Hee and she was only getting in the way of them. In fact, their friendship and brotherhood was the best thing about this drama and truly the driving force of the whole thing. Which is why in the end, when Joon Hee leaves (after experiencing more headaches that are never explained) it makes no sense! Why would he stay gone for years and years? He wouldn't. Lastly, since everyone is talking about Sehun, I want to throw in my two cents: I think he did a really good job. I went into this having seen a few of his older dramas and not being very impressed, so I was pleasantly surprised. This was a great role for him. He had great chemistry with all of his co-stars and was, in my opinion, the heart of the drama.  I would love to see him take on more roles like this one in the future. In the end, I'm  disappointed with this drama, but it was short and had enough heart to keep me watching until the end."

Watching this is like doing an unwanted chore. Such a waste of opportunity!After saving it in my to-watch list the first day I saw the trailer on Netflix, I cleared my Friday night schedule to binge all the episodes, prepared my popcorn, (and beer) popped the first episode and I'm hooked! The first episode was compelling and was such a gorefest, I thought it is exactly how I want my horror show.  The very first attack by the school nurse was heartstopping and showed a lot of promise. Sadly, after the 3rd episode, I am snoozing like a baby, drools and all. My expectations are low when it comes to horror. I come to be entertained and have a good time, and the more gruesome and the more bloody the better. Having said that, I have set my bar even lower for this series because I know it's teen-centric and I just want to enjoy and not nitpick details. This show, however, exceeded in delivering mind-numbing foolishness, and it's so easy to hate almost all characters that you can't stop wishing all of them would just be bitten.The story is simple enough but could have been a goldmine of ideas and exciting scenarios.  Instead, they dropped stupid and repetitive scenarios one after another. The character's eyes keep popping like a light bulb every time they think (or they think they thought of) of brilliant ideas to outsmart the zombies. You just can't help but cheer the zombies to finally have a go at it and just kill the characters:1. One of the most frustrating is the way they handled Ohn Jo's father, they were building the story for him to be the big rescuer, and that he will do everything to save his daughter only to die minutes after reuniting with her.  We were shouting at the screen when that happened cause they all clearly have a path to get away from the zombies, especially right after when he threw the first flare because it seems they can all go safely, Then, he unnecessarily threw the second and third flares. Very anti-climatic for his arc just to create the drama. 2. Seems like they were intent on just unnecessarily killing all the adults alive in the school to keep the narrative that the teens are on their own. 3. The vlogger was just a nuisance. I don't understand his importance to the story cause he did nothing at all.4. Do I need to mention Chiong San's mom? What about his dad who mysteriously disappeared?5, The police force. My goodness! I love Lee Kyu Hyung and even if his character here was almost the same as in Happiness, he is still also one of the few bright spots of the series. However, the whole Hyosan police force was just a dimwit bunch. Did you see how easy it was for the zombies to overrun the friggin police headquarters? The guys at the school put up a much better fight than these weakling cops. They got the main culprit -the brain behind the virus and they know the virus is spreading and you interrogate him like it's a normal crime? Has no one there thought of coordinating with the other agencies, and telling them that they have the crazy scientist, turn him over and make him do the antidote or something.  No, they all panicked when the zombies attacked the police station, no one even thought of maybe finding some weapons because just maybe there are some because THEY ARE IN THE FRIGGIN POLICE  STATION!6. What about the assemblywoman? What's her actual contribution to the whole story?7. Did you see how the teen mom tied her hands with that ribbon, to keep her from eating the baby? She's a zombie, not a gift box, that ribbon looks so thin that when she became a zombie she could have snapped it easily. Oh but that ribbon is made of steel and it held her overnight. And that baby? It must have superhuman powers to survive that long without milk.8. The bullied girl in the rooftop. I was thinking they'd give her a recovery arc, but no, she is just as self-centered as her bullies. She was so happy to announce that she SET THE SCHOOL ON FIRE, but girl has to check that statement cause all she did was burn the papers in the office, nothing more. Hasn't she seen the fire sprinklers working? A fight between her and GwiNam could have been epic.9. And OMG that bullied guy. I kinda understand why he did what he did on the rooftop, but then he was at the camp, met this girl, and he tells him I want to eat you, and then he just let her. That scenario alone could have opened a lot of possible chaotic scenarios inside the camp. I was kinda expecting the zombies to spread there, but no, nothing of that sort. It's like the guy's existence is just to make the abandonment of the kids in the rooftop climatic, which by the way is not.10. I would like to mention the countless stupid ways to escape a zombie apocalypse but this is already way too long. They even spent almost an episode literally talking about shit. They complained about thirst and hunger but didn't bother to find food and water and yet they spent quite some time teaching us how to do the number 2 during an apocalypse.What makes it sadder, is that I find not a single character to latch on to - not the drama queen, not her puppy best friend, not the pretend goody goody jock, not even the smartass who could have been their gifted savior. What they delivered instead was a puke-invoking bunch of whiny pimpled teenage characters who can't stop talking about their silly crushes and quite a few useless adult characters who make selfish and terrible decisions. There are only two characters I didn't hate- Gwi Nam is a scary psycho and the funny delinquent Mi-Jin. Had they shifted the focus to these two, they could have created a witty frightening gore. I just have to add that my favorite part was when they were on the rooftop and singing cause that felt sincere.I can't help but wonder why this show got a 12-episode order as opposed to Kingdom which has 6 per season and Sweet Home which has 10. The show could have used a lot of editing and maybe it will feel better if it was just 8 or even 10.I recommend having a go at it using your mobile device, that way you can change the playback speed, otherwise, if you're watching on your smart tv just have the remote ready and just feel free to skip the boring parts. I promise you, you won't miss anything. Hard to rewatch, unfortunately."

It shows the struggles of young actress So Ri, who is trying to be famous for seven years (I think it was seven...) and she still is living an ordinary life, even though she is starting to get recognized. The story was ambitious and it was filmed in the format of a documentary (I guess a mockumentary), however, it felt chopped, like they edited scenes together, or, rather, they spread the story too thinly. Because it was character-centered, it would have been better if they didn't add that romance story in it and they had rather focused more on her relationship with her ex band members, her career and her journey overall. Unfortunately, many things were skipped forward regarding her career and they opted for a half baked romance and an open ending, which, actually, for me at least, it fitted the personality of the main character.For the performances, as the drama focused on So Ri, you get most of the scenes with her. The actress did a great job with every scene and she was a delight to watch. The rest of the cast was very professional and enjoyable.So, overall, five out of ten for this webdrama.PS I usually rate with a scale from 1 to 8 when it comes to web series"

I was looking forward to see Kang Byul, she did great in ""Ugly Alert"" but her character in this one didn't appeal to me or whatsoever. She was one of those characters that are more holy than a saint. Drama writers need to understand that this trope for the protagonists is stale and boring. All the love lines were straight up awful from start to finish, they went full retardation with it. The leads triangle was pure cringe and childish, it would be infinitely better if none of the leads had a relationship/romance. I'm tired of watching Yoon Ho begging In Jeong every single episode, the man can't take a hint. By the way, weak ending as usual."

Eventually they learn to embrace what has happened and make the most out of it. Amor Fati. ""Love of one's fate."" This phrase would apply to every character in the show.The subplots also talk about a few things that aren't portrayed very often in K-dramas, particularly child depression, homosexuality, and family abuse. They aren't easy topics to discuss, but are handled with care in the show.My only particular issue with the show is how quickly things wrapped up near the end. Although we are given at least a week's worth of episodes for the epilogue to show how the characters are doing later, there was no build up to them. The four main characters receive a nice conclusion, but the side character stories all wrap up in the final episode, leaving me unsatisfied as they felt rushed. The side characters were just as important as the main ones as they helped carry the show to have enough content for 120 episodes.Oh well. Amor Fati."

I mean, how can someone skip a whole day in a few minutes, even if it's a drama, and not make it look wierd ? In addition, the story was okay, not anything too original to keep you entertained for long, but there was a major twist in the end, at least. Finally, the girl who played Bom was not really good with her expressions, expecially in the first episodes. She did got a bit better, but, overall, she was bad.

Written by   screenwriter Choi Yoon Kyo,   Angels The Last Mission: Love was a fairly sweet and hard-hitting romance tale starring a fairly talented cast consisting of   Shin Hye Sun, L, Gil Eun Hye and Lee Dong Gun. Nevertheless whilst an enjoyable watch, the drama was not flawed from imperfections either. Before critiquing some of the shows more prominent flaws, it is important to clarify that the majority of the cast were  brilliant  in their performances. In particular, Shin Hye Sun ( who played our  female lead, the cynical ballerina  Lee Yeon Seo) has always been a versatile actresses within her performances ( The Legend Of The Blue Sea, Stranger and Mr. Queen), however, she truly seemed to capture the  the emotions and depth of her character in nearly every scene. ( In addition to this, her months of training in ballet did help to add towards her genuine performance.) Likewise whilst fellow actress Gil Eun Hyes character Geum Ru Na  and Lee Dong Guns character   Ji Kang Woo could  equally be infuriating at times , Eun Hye and Dong Gun  certainly gave talented performances onscreen. Admittedly, Kim Myungsoo ( otherwise known by his stage name  L for the  K-Pop boyband INFINITE) has always had a fairly mixed-reputation  as an actor by critics. Nevertheless, he seemed to be en par with his costar Hye Sun within his genuinely heartfelt, delivered performance as our kind-hearted angel Dan who gradually helps our female lead to be uplifted from her own pain and suffering. However, this does naturally moves us onto the more critical issue of the storyline, cliches and characters. The storyline seems to initiate a fairly coherent plot ; the angel  Dan is sent to earth as a human after disobeying initial orders, enters Lee Yeon Seos life  as a human, begins to become her pillar of support,  naturally begins to fall in love with her as  challenges are evidently raised.Undeniably, Lee Yeon Seo was an intriguing female lead and character. Initially starting off the series as a ballerina who has fallen from grace after being blinded in an accident, Yeon Seos reasons for being often sardonic and austere around the associated individuals within her life were realistically more complicated than simply being  one-dimensional. Refreshingly, this did not victimise  Yeon  Seo as being entirely  weak or a  damsel in distress, with private revelations of  Yeon Seos multi-layered  feelings of guilt or remorse often after lashing out in earlier scenes . On the other hand, there is the evident plot point early on regarding   Yeon Seo ( without  spoilers). Admittedly this is a fantasy series where logic isnt  always a necessity, however, considering the extent of this development for the character, it was oddly thrown-in without explanations. Despite this, Yeon Seos greatest development comes in the form of her romantic relationship with Dan as both someone to lean on as well as learn to open-up towards over the course of the series. Whilst undeniably pivotal to characterisation, it never truly made sense towards the entire bond between Yeon Seo and the second male lead Kang Woo in the same intimate way ( although admittedly always more platonic for Yeon Seo) as her relationship and growth with Dan. (Apart from a  challenge to the plot by adding in cliches.)Before moving onto our main male lead, it is probably important on a side note to address the second leads Kang Woo and Ru Na. Whilst Kang  Woo was given the primary purpose as the  obstacle for Dans affections, his revealed backstory did help to break his initial mould with more complicated reasons for being intrigued with the female lead. Meanwhile Ru Na was a fairly unlikeable character in the beginning of the series by her initial enmity against Yeon Seo as a lead ballerina  as well as later schemes against  the female lead also. Whilst there was slight brought towards Ru Na as a character, her rushed ending alongside Kang Woo felt half-baked and incomplete. Moving onto our main lead, Dan is a character who could have easily fallen down the trap of rarely breaking from  the  nice male lead  archetype. Thankfully just as viewers got insight into Yeon Seos complicated life, Dan was also given some insight behind his seemingly benign and benevolent traits as an angel .However, Dans biggest fault as a character came through the implausibilities surrounding his backstory at times, as well as his stunted character growth in parts. Nevertheless similar to Yeon Seo, Dans focal point as a character in the series was ensued by his relationship with the respected female lead by equivocally helping to nurture one anothers past wounds . The ending of the series was undeniably  bittersweet with fairly profound moral messages, yet it did feel slightly abridged in parts during the penultimate episode and finale. Overall, the drama was surprisingly heartfelt by most of the characters being able to break out of typical cliches, a surprisingly  eclectic OST playlist  as well as well-performed performances by the cast who helped to bring these characters to life onscreen. It was not a flawless drama with noticeable  inconsistencies of storyline and cliches , but it was an oddly compelling  fantasy romance story  and definitely worth watching if youre a fan of romance dramas."

This drama takes us through the life of Anna wherein we discover how little lies along the way can cause irreparable damage and steal your real identity away. The best thing I loved about this is how it started during the early part of Anna's life and continued through the years as she grew up. The highlights and important events in her life gave me a sense of the nature and development of her character and her personality and in turn, made me understand why she made the decisions she made and why she did the things she did. I'm not justifying her actions, but I do understand.This started out really strong but I felt like it fell flat in the middle. Anna used to be this unstoppable force in the beginning and in the middle, she was just...there. It was actually something that I can make sense of. She was trying so hard and of course, there will always be that point when you get too exhausted and just don't want to try anymore. However, I don't think this circumstance was carried out in a way that the essence of the message will reach the general audience. It felt close to boring.Everything kind of fell into place but the ending was unremarkable given the potential. There was this big incident in the ending and I just thought they didn't take the tension and suspense to their advantage because after that, the next events were just ""meh"". They actually could've ended it with that incident and it would have been exceptional, to be honest.I know there had been a dispute over this between the director and the streaming platform that aired it but the version I've watched is the director's cut, which is the extended version, so I can't compare.Suzy is one of my favorite Korean actresses and I do admit that she's not that phenomenal in acting but she delivered such an astounding performance in this! The shift and range in her emotions through her eyes alone, literally breathtaking! She has brought Anna to life and she did a damn good job that's why I really connected with the character. I felt her hope, her sadness, her anger,  I felt Anna. The music also added colors to the story and fit the mood.Honestly, we're all just Anna sometimes. When things don't work out no matter how hard we try, we lie a little sometimes, not only to others, but especially to ourselves. It's easier than admitting that you failed, because we are not only failing ourselves, but those who believe in us. We kept justifying the failures with lies and we kept justifying the lies brought by the failures. This drama has made me realize that if you resist and refuse to admit failure, you will never experience success. Humbling yourself and accepting that you failed is the first step to find your way to success again."

Flashbacks happen in the middle of conversations and sometimes it's hard to immediately discern the difference between past and present because they cut so seamlessly, especially when the characters are in the same position for both scenarios.

It's not because it's perfect, but it's because I loved every single episode from beginning to the end. The cast is Amazing, and includes some of my now favorite KDrama characters EVER! The story was totally different than any other romcom I've seen, and kept me fully engaged from the beginning until the end. My rewatch score is an easy 10, since I was often tempted to rewatch episodes immediately while waiting impatiently for new episodes to come out. The music has been on steady rotation in my playlist too.Most people will be skeptical that this drama deserves all the praise it will likely get, I know I would be. A common question has been, ""Is it really that good?"". Umm... YES. The answer is YES, in ALLCAPS.Let's start at the beginning, which most people call slow, but I was completely fascinated from the very first scene. I had a friend who was a sound editor, and I always thought the job was so fascinating, but I love the way they weave that element in throughout the show. I think it's the attention to details like that that makes this drama stand out more than others. Add the psychic premonition/flash forward element to that, and I was hooked for sure. I just had to know what was going to happen next.I think the writing was really extraordinary in how they married all the different genres together without ever totally losing it's charm. Watching it felt like being on a roller coaster. I liked the ebb and flow of the story... Some moments are cute, some intense, some are passionate, some are heartbreaking, then frustrating, then suddenly hilarious... In telling the story of a mature and truly complicated relationship, they never settle on sticking to one approach for too long. Some people who joined in for the romance may get annoyed during the depressing & frustrating parts, and those looking for suspense probably got bored during the extra romantic moments, but I was too invested in the story to ever be bored, and I knew the story would never stay on one type of moment for too long. I know that personally that ""surfing"" shirt kept haunting my dreams... One can criticize certain parts of the story for not being realistic, but being real is not my criteria for a great drama. In fact, the only other drama I could see myself giving perfect 10s to is Secret Garden, for most of the same reasons, and that is definitely not a drama that relies on being ""real"". All the authenticity this drama needs comes from the portrayal of the characters.Seo Hyun Jin as Regular Oh Hae Yeong, and Eric Moon as Do Kyeong, are not the ideal dream couple on paper. They are emotionally damaged, dysfunctional, and certainly imperfect, but I fell in love with both characters as they fell in love with each other. Regular Oh Hae Yeong's vulnerability broke my heart, and yet inspired me. Do Kyeong's guarded personality was frustrating, and yet I was completely empathetic towards him. The banter in the beginning was fun, their chemistry is perfect, the intensity of their intimacy got me in the feels, and they have the best KDrama kisses EVER. Seriously... ever. No need to fear them touching lips together while standing awkwardly. Eric plays repressed so well, that you would never think that he had it in him. I definitely swooned several times. I am a romcom fan, and have a lot of favorite couples, but they definitely leaped their way to the top couples on my list.Then there is the rest of the cast. If I could give higher than 10 to some of the supporting cast I would. Regular Hae Young's parents are the best parents in dramaland... FACT. The family moments were equally touching and laugh out loud funny. Kim Mi Kyung is just so good, and Lee Han Wi balanced her out perfectly. Any scene with them in it was automatically a good one. The rest of the supporting cast were all 10s, or close enough, and there are way too many too mention, but shout out to the bromancemobile! Jeon Hye Bin, and Lee Jae Yoon didn't have to rest on being attractive. They each had complicated characters who had me rooting against them while totally feeling sorry for them. I admit that I HATED Pretty Oh Hae Young, but that's because she played her part so well. Tae Jin was much more sympathetic, but both of them made the complicated love dilemma work well. Kim Ji Suk, Heo Jeong Min, and Heo Young Ji all had very fun and memorable characters, but the true MVP of this whole drama to me is Ye Ji Won. She is my power animal! I had no idea, in her first scenes, how much I would end up adoring her character. Even If the story sucked, and the rest of the cast sucked, I would still be glued to the screen waiting to see what kind of shenanigans she would do next. I don't want to even slightly spoil any of her moments, because the surprise randomness of it is what makes it comic genius. I need to stalk her in something else. If you know of any dramas where she is particularly awesome, please let me know!I already mentioned rewatch value, but just to be clear, I am tempted to rewatch the whole thing right now. I'll try to wait longer before I watch it again, but I will, without a doubt, be watching it all again... and again.The music is now one of my favorite OSTs. I listen to certain songs over and over and never get tired. What Is Love is too cute, and I love that Seo Hyun Jin is singing! Ben's Like a Dream started playing in a store and had me singing along like I know the words... no, I do not speak Korean, much less sing in Korean. Maybe I by Roy Kim is like musical crack. Needless to say, the OST is really good.Overall, I don't know what I am going to do with my Mondays & Tuesdays now that it's over. I rarely watch on air dramas, but I am so glad I watched this one. I think it was worth it from beginning to end, and yes I did like the ending, but I won't say too much about it other than that I thought it was... in it's own way... perfect ; )So yes I recommend it very highly. I think a romcom hater, or a melodrama hater, or a suspense hater could all agree that there is surprisingly a little something for everyone. I also loved the message at the end. Now excuse me while I make some room for this drama, and it's cast on my favorites lists."

But once they delved into the highly predictable territory of rotten chaebols and politicians, I lost interest really quickly. I finished it since it was only 8 episodes long. And that was a good and a bad thing at the same time. On the good side the drama was finished quickly and I could let a sigh of relief when all the corruption plot left my screen. On the downside, I was not happy with the episode count because the drama had an amazing cast of characters which were not sufficiently explored. Apart from the main character, the Argon anchor, everyone else was left behind very quickly and was eventually used as aprop for the ML's redemption arc. For example, there was the rookie journalist, a mercenary who was hated when she arrived but managed to keep her cool and prove herself. Another one was a journalist who ruined the show because he hero worshipped the anchor. There was also the slimy rival anchor who was more worried about ratings than reporting the facts and corrupt to the bone. There was also another journalist with interesting family only slightly hinted at but never really talked about. And so on and so on...I really hope that Korea is not the country represented in these dramas: highly corrupted and easily corruptible individuals who rule over it and its economy together with the millions of hate filled envious and anonymous netizens who spew their frustration at the slightest misstep and arte used as a guideline. This is the real horror. Zombies and monsters are CareBears in comparison!"

Its not exactly groundbreaking, but it could serve as a rather entertaining watch if you dont try to pay too much attention to plotlines, or are willing to imagine half of the story that is never told to fill the gaps. Some characters journeys were well written, some barely existed which leads me to one conclusion: there wasnt a balance in the quality of writing. Yeo Joon is for sure the star of the show, the most interesting and well portrayed character. They did a good job with his introduction and character development. It was gradual and realistic. We witnessed him try to fight his demons alone, still learning how to open to others, even as the drama got closer to the end. Park Ji Hoon did an amazing job acting - some scenes giving me real goosebumps.That said, it was disappointing to see just a little of the screen time used to explore his relationship with the family,  seeing how it defined who he was and how he acted for the majority of his life... so for it to not have more importance in the healing aspect was a bit... weird?Soo Hyun might be the main character, but he did not get enough screen time as one. With that, his character development is nowhere near as well written as Yeo Joon's. It was not as organic and natural. He was one of my favorite characters, so I was a bit sad with the fact there wasnt more focus placed on him. And then there is the issue of Soo Hyun being straight in the show, when he is gay in the webtoon - truly hate it. Its infuriating. They could have not given him any love line and use that time to develop his character more. Some people can ignore that, but some people would not pick up a show that is straightwashing characters, so do with this information what you want. Last but not least from the three heroes of the show: Kim So Bin, who technically could have worked as a main character, if she would be well written and incorporated into the story. She got a good character introduction, they set up some nice conflicts - both internal and external but then did nothing with them. Her existence revolves around Yeo Joon - she is there for him to like, to make him want to change, to save her She had enough screen time for an amazing development, it was just not given to her. Even almost at the end of the show... she is there to be saved by Yeo Joon after making stupid decisions and not being able to say no... by now she should have been more than that.Young Ran and Mi Joo showed a realistic portrayal of ""love rivalry"" between friends. As much as I dislike the love triangle and how unnecessary it was, I still appreciate it gave us a good representation of female friendship. That said, as individual characters... I find it sad most of their arc is focused on unrequited love as if they don't have anything else going on in their lives. Especially with Mi Joo girl needs a hobby or something.For a show that is suppose to focus on healing, realistic portrayal of college life and growth The lack of consequences characters faced is staggering. How they resolved some of the conflicts involving the seniors was simply unrealistic. Sorry, but you cannot make a character that unlikeable and then for no reason say well maybe they are not that bad after all - yes, yes they are unless you give me character development which would make me believe they are not trash. Honestly speaking, I went into the drama without reading the webtoon, ans started reading it only half way through the show. Was hoping for friendship, and romance as side plot. Sadly, the romance was the center of the directing, getting the most screen time out of all plot lines. By the end, they started to pair everyone up, was it really necesary?If you want to watch it only for bromance after reading the synopsis, dont bother - just check fanmade videos on youtube. Otherwise, there will a lot of skipping scenes ahead of you.Overall: I would be lying if I said I did not enjoy even a second of At a Distance, Spring Is Green. Some aspects were great, but some were annoyingly bad. Its a good drama for a younger audience, far less tragic and serious than the first two episodes present. As long as you don't expect a masterpiece, and are willing to forgive some underdeveloped and forgotten plot lines, you will enjoy it. The production value is obviously high, and they use the university setting well. Not to mention great summer vibes OST."

You can't really come back from that, regardless of the particulars. 

And the particulars just aren't great. The directing and the acting are marginally better than the writing, but they're nothing to write home about, and at the end of the day the whole thing reeks of sanctimony. It's poorly structured, fails to bring its themes to life in any credible way, and wastes more time on its heroes' epic backstories than it spends with any of the characters they claim to speak for. The working class are presented as victims, objects of sympathy who must be saved from their tragic lot in life by a couple of Heroes doing heroic things. Don't expect their struggle to gain some agency and leverage in the workplace to come with any leverage or agency in the story.

If I had to sum up, I'd say that it's basically a mix between a dumbed-down political action piece that simultaneously deals in polemics and avoids taking a stand on anything beyond the obvious (the system is built to exploit the poor! Illegal=bad!), and a facsimile of a ""serious"" drama written by someone who doesn't understand what makes those shows tick."

STORY
If i could place this show under a genre i would say it is a psychological thriller, while i was expecting it to be a drama about adultery. Yes, you are right, it is obvious from the description, the concept here is infidelity. Hot and young babysitter works at a prestigious and rich house, apparently she will seduce her master, possibly she came there on purpose, all those thoughts all everyone made before watching this and the first episode will confirm all your assumptions. The drama starts ominously, focusing on the wife in the aftermath of the adultery talking to a journalist about what she's done (oh yes it will get dark fast!)

However the drama -fortunately- has way more to give than just a usual adultery story. Firstly let me talk about that. Adultery, possibly the most hated concept in kdramaland, and my favourite one. I have watched quite a few kdramas that deal with it, all of them had something in common: they tried to give the adulterer reasons that semi-excused their actions, and/or made us pitty/like/feel sorry for them. I was shocked that here this isn't the case. I doubt i have ever seen such a sly, cunning, borderline scary lady, dead set on seducing a married man, having no qualms about her actions. But is she really just a slut that she wants the rich married man? Or is there more to her story?

Secondly, i have to praise the fact that the show featured a lot more than just the cheating. It focuses more on the implications this action had on the wife, and how she coped with everything. Not it isn't dramatic at all, but it is surprising. It featured public humiliation, and went as far as mental illness and more. Thankfully everything clicked by the end, giving a very satisfying, plot-twisty and unpredictable ending! Everything that happens is highly unrealistic of course, completely makjang. One could call the whole drama 'trashy', and i can't argue with that, i agree, but it is definitely entertaining.

The show never gets dragged, and is never boring. People might find the first episode boring since it focuses on the adultery, i love that concept and i found the way it was presented here refreshing. The last episode and the plot twists are worth getting through the first episode though, this is just 4 episodes in total anyway.

The only drawbacks i can point out is that the show closed with some questions left unanswered and some minor plot holes. However, none of them bother me enough to give this a lower score.

ACTING
The two female leads have the most significant roles and they were both good enough but not mindblowing.
Jo Yeo Jung came a long way since her I need romance days. This says tons about how a role can make you or break you. She presented her character greatly, she was indeed scary and borderline crazy throughout the whole thing. My only complain would be her angry scenes, i didn't feel them at all.

Shin Yoon Joo was ok. What i loved were her scary facial expressions and evil smirks. I loved the way she smiled, totally ominous and dark. However on some of her important speech scenes her face was blunt and deadpan. This was her first acting work and she good an ok job imo.

Kim Min Joon was great at what he was placed there to be, the apple of discord. He was totally hot in every scene he was in, and acting-wise he was impeccable as well. Same goes for Lee Seung Chan as the two of the played the middle-aged playboys, he wasn't as good-looking as KMJ but still charming in his own way.

RECOMMEND/REWATCH
I wouldn't recommend this to everyone at first as i thought it was an adultery drama/melo. Since this ended being more on the thriller side, and since its just 4 episodes long, i do believe it is essential for watching. I would definately rewatch this with someone else, but not alone again, once is enough."

Over the top, filled with cringe comedy and ridiculousness; this drama somehow made me go from shaking my head at its antics to thoroughly enjoying it in an endeared mannerFirst of all let's talk about the elephant in the room. I am not going to deny that this show is problematic. Even if we skip the fact that this 'family drama' is derived from a very ethically questionable adult webtoon and is bound to direct attention towards the source material, there are still many other things to frown upon. In the very first episode, the FL (a highschooler) kisses the ML (an adult and a stranger) without his permission, then goes on to be very handsy with him throughout the show despite knowing that he has a girlfriend, beats up people left and right and well, basically does a lot of what your typical drama 'bad boys' usually do. (It's inappropriate behavior regardless of the gender.)Then, in a very ignorant fashion, for comedic purposes the drama introduces a supporting character (ML's best friend) that has angered the international community for culture appropriation and rightfully so. Korean dramas have never been known to handle sensitive topics 'sensitively' and should know to stay away from them which Backstreet Rookie clearly does not do. It helps that he has reduced screen-time as episodes progress and that the fast forward button comes in particularly handy for his scenes.So if these things make you shy away from the drama then it's completely understandable and you should do you.But now for those who were able to walk past the controversy: The thing is while being ignorant, the drama clearly is not malicious. It's pretty obvious that they are just trying way too hard to be funny and sometimes it strikes true and you're left in fits of laughter and other times it doesn't and the result is just embarrassing.Soon we realize that the FL; a young girl who doesn't have it easy, who lost her father too early, who has been raising her sister alone is quite a lost child inside. She is aggressive at first in her persuit for the ML (who is the only one who seemed to give a shit about her) but soon she becomes more mature and thoughtful. She is strong, stands up for herself and those she cares for and loves fiercely. After you get through the first episodes, she becomes an increasingly likable heroine and you can't help but root for her.This role doesn't do anything for Ji Chang Wook as an actor. His character is not the typical male lead and not very attractive. He is a pushover, a 30 year old man who lives with his parents, doesn't have a lot of self respect, let's people run over him and despite his good looks, he doesn't do much in the beginning. However, soon you see his strong sense of justice, his love for his own family and the fact that he is literally an actual good human being and so you warm up to him.The acting is great across the board. The main couple looks so good together (the romance follows with both of them being legal adults) with great chemistry. The OST is stunning and the cringe comedic camera effects during action scenes also grow on you after a while.The best thing about it, is that even though it's very obviously in your face slapstick, the drama comes with these surprisingly heart warming and emotional moments that sneak up on you and hit you in the feels.Also, since it is by the same creators as The Fiery Priest, it has A LOT of drama references that are absolutely gold and leave you roaring with laughter.Overall, it's a light hearted romantic comedy, that doesn't take itself seriously.So I'd say if you tried the show and couldn't get past the objectionable material, that's perfectly fine but if you are one those who want to watch this show and are hesitating just because of the negativity surrounding it, I suggest you give it a try and let the drama make its case first.Enjoy!"
Bad Girlfriend,,,8958,2022.0,2022.0,12,,,,"Ji Soo, an advertising planner who is faithful to her desire to date someone she likes, is proud of her working abilities at her company. She is dating Tae Oh who is her superior at work and Ji Ho, a cheerful young man, who is out there trying to make ends meet. But when Ji Ho went to work at Ji Soo's company, Ji Soo's daily life, which seemed perfect, began to collapse... Will Ji Soo be able to handle all this and continue her two-legged relationship?(Source: Naver)","Byeon Seo Yoon, Park Young Woon, Yang Hyuk, Yoo Jung Hoo",Naver TV Cast Viki vLive,"Come on. Really?  Where do I begin? This feeds into every stereotype you hear about polyamorous people: They're greedy, selfish, wishy-washy, manipulative, and just ""bad"" people. The FL, Ji Soo, is the perfect embodiment of these stereotypes. Ji Soo knows she leads people on, lies to them, and cares more about herself than others. She readily admits it to her best friend, Hyeon Woo, out loud multiple times. I think it's worse to be fully aware of your bad behavior and do nothing about it than to be completely ignorant of how your actions affect others. The story itself also pushes back against validating polyamory at nearly every turn. That will become clear later in this review.Little polyamory lesson coming from someone who practices monogamy but knows a decent amount about it: Polyamory is when you engage in multiple romantic and/or sexual relationships with the consent of all partners involved.This woman labels her loving multiple people as wrong, which it's not. She doesn't need to feel guilty about not being able to choose between two guys or date ""normally."" What she DOES need to feel guilty about is sneaking around behind their backs. It is not correct polyamory if you are not informing them. They think you are exclusive and you are lying by omission. When Tae Oh and Ji Ho finally know what's going on and are able to give informed consent, we get a brief glimpse of what could have been. When she is with one partner unexpectedly she informs the other out of consideration, she attempts to give both men time out of her day, and she equally expresses love and physical affection.But then, it's ruined again. She kisses Hyeon Woowithout his consent, I might addwithout asking her partners beforehand, talking to them about what she's going through, or taking their feelings into consideration. And the cherry on top of this is that she never tells Tae Oh or Ji Ho what she did.The end sees her breaking up with both of them because she feels they shouldn't continue when they each want to exclusively be with her, and she ends up dating Hyeon Woo while seeing other guys casually.This left me frustrated for so many reasons. For one, there isn't much, if anything, to indicate she loves Hyeon Woo. When she goes to bang on Hyeon Woo's door and ends up kissing him, she's only thinking about how much she misses her best friend and wants him back in her life so they can do the activities they enjoy together. She's not thinking about how she feels differently about him now; she just kisses him out of the blue and says she was doing it to see if she liked him. Then he tells her that he wants to date her and that if she wants that she will need to break up with her boyfriends. He says he's not okay with her seeing other people while she's with him. He is very clear about this. This leads to my second reason, how in the hell do they expect me to believe he magically came around?! How? He is very firm about it just being them and then comes around out of nowhere. Out of nowhere! My third reason: what the people who made the show wanted to say. I think them going for her dating Hyeon Woo while casually seeing other guys was to give less endorsement of polyamory. They couldn't show her seriously dating two men and equally loving them. They went for the option that is closer to a ""normal"" relationship. Also, so they could continue to call her a ""bad girl"" for what she's doing. Basically saying, ""She's messing around. Isn't that so bad of her?"" And my fourth reason, Tae Oh and Ji Ho were starting to like each other (not romantically) and seemed pretty content staying dating Ji Soo together. It would have made sense for them to tell Ji Soo they want to stay as they are, not just go along with the breakup.Okay, for my own peace of mind, I'm going to rewrite the end of this drama. Fanfiction/directing incoming: Ji Soo goes to the restaurant to drink soju, feeling upset about the absence of her best friend (she doesn't kiss him). Her ex still shows up and says everything he did before, she is moved by her boyfriends' verbal defense of their relationship, and the fight still happens. But on the walk back to her place she takes both their hands and tells them, ""I know we haven't finished the project yet and we said that's when I'd make my decision. But . . . I love you both. Equally. I can't choose between you, Tae Oh and Ji Ho. Please understand. I want to keep dating you. Can we stay together? Just like this?"" Tae Oh and Ji Ho look at each other and then at Ji Soo. They give slight smiles, and she pulls them in for a hug. The guys look awkwardly at each other but then also embrace. The next day the video still gets released, and things look grim for all of them. She feels guilty, but Tae Oh and Ji Ho both comfort her individually, reminding her that they decided to fight. Getting courage from them, she stands up to the boss and puts her job on the line so they can stay on the project. While Ji Soo is shown giving a presentation, Ji Ho smiles to himself, noticing how lovingly Tae Oh looks at her. The project is completed successfully, and Ji Soo still hands in her resignation. Flash forward to three months later, and we see Tae Oh dropping her off at her new job. He gives her a kiss on the cheek as she opens the car door. She sits at her desk and begins to work. The camera focuses in on her right, where there is a framed picture of her, Tae Oh, and Ji Ho at the park laughing together. Later she has lunch with Ji Ho at the cafe where they met. While waiting for their dessert, he holds her hand across the table. Finally, they are shown having dinner all together at her place. Tae Oh and Ji Ho bicker over the dishes they made, and Ji Soo laughs at them. Cut to credits. The end.I feel better now."

Not only was it impactful it had me wondering why I had kept off watching it for such a long time. I thoroughly enjoyed the first installation of Bad Guys, not that I see this as a sequel but more as an extension and a pivotal one at that. The extent to which law, order, and justice are marginalized, making gangsters out of those who swore to protect the sanctity of the law, is horrifying. I can only imagine how bad it mustve been for anyone, let alone a team of prosecutors, detectives, and public service persons, to take extreme measures of hiring and working with lawbreakers to catch criminals. I couldnt for a life of me understand why this group of law officials turned gangsters would need Noh Jin Pyung (Kim Mu Yeol), a rookie prosecutor on their team. Not only that, throw him in the chaos and expect him to follow suit blindly. I was baffled until I realized Noh wasnt just a witness that could bring Jo Young Gooks (Kim Hong Pa) criminal organization down but was a pivotal member of OH Goo Taks (Kim Sang Joong) Bad Guys. It all starts to make sense. Aside from the impressive opener, I hadnt realized Joo Jin Mo was part of Bad Guys: Vile Citys cast. I genuinely enjoy his method acting style. The way he immerses himself in his roles, and particularly here as Heo Il Hoo, a widely feared, former violent mobster who turns to the right side of the law after an assassination attempt, was fantastic to watch. Kim Mu Yeol, on the other hand, I was not familiar with until this drama, and he has my respect. The way he delivers the role, the conflict between good and evil, always on edge, constantly torn between law and lawlessness, was beyond impressive. Woo Je-mun (Park Joong-hoon) is another actor I am embarrassed to say I had never encountered before as an experienced prosecutor on a crusade. After losing two colleagues trying to follow the letter of the law, he decides to employ the same dirty tricks his target uses. The same goes for Ji Soo as Han Gang-Joo, a young man, a killer who lived his entire life as an underdog, making every sacrifice to support and protect his younger sister. After an assassination attempt on his sister (meanwhile, the mayors secretary), Gang-Joo joins the investigative team, both for revenge and atonement. There is no forgetting Jang Sung Cheol (Yang Ik-June), psychopathic gambling, drug addict detective, broken to no repair but ironically determined, without compromise, to fight corruption to his last breath. Of course, theres no forgetting Ji Seung Hyun as hitman Joo Jae Pil for the short time he was in the drama. He is a versatile actor who seems to excel in any role he takes, be it a sensitive veterinary in You Are My Spring to a morally ambiguous newspaper report in The Good Detective or a straight and narrow conglomerate in Hello Me.A lot happens in Bad Guys: Vile City and when one takes a closer look at the totality of what makes a group of prosecutors and police detectives unafraid to deal out random violence and torture, but not only that band with an ex-mobster and an assassin, one can understand why they become determined to cross the line to battle organized crime, get revenge, and end institutional corruption in their city. More than the method Bad Guys: Vile City uses to reach its goal, its the journey it takes where a group of people who have nothing in common bond and come together beyond their common purpose sets it apart from other like dramas in a way including Bad Guys."

I wish it maintained the same consistency as the first half. The one thing that bothered me the most, and will probably bother everyone else, is how they terrorized Ha Eun, almost too much. On another note, two couples got together in real life and married after the drama finished filming. The first couple was Ho Jin & Kate/Yoo Jin which absolutely a delight, even their age gap is real.

However, the title - Bad and Crazy should have given me  a clue of the things to come.From being a cop show, it took a slightly bad turn and suddenly became a show about mental illness. I enjoyed it, however, i found that the first and  second acts about catching bad and corrupt politician, and then the cops, all while fighting the scary russian mafia were a lot more compelling than the split personality drama. I do feel like they suddenly cut the drug issue short and that it wasnt closed properly. It's like it was done because they already exceeded the episode numbers and its almost time to close the curtain and show the crazy doctor. After all, Boss Yong was magnificently played and was scary as hell, and could have been a much better overall antagonist.I loved the action, i love the mystery, i loved the support casts,  I loved the rock music theme.

Since I saw Byun Jung Soo in ""Manny (2011)"", I can only remember her as Janice as she screams ""I'm Janice!"". Lee Yoo Ri cameo around the ending was superb.Some serious illogical assery in spoilers:- Dal Hee/Sera Park, Miss Lee and Tae Soo all were alive and barely punished at the end but Se Kyung is dead. In what absurd logic does this make sense!!- They built up Ha Ri and Gi Chan to be together for +50 episodes, they confessed their feelings to each other, their parents in law agreed to give them their blessings, yet somehow for whatever bullshit reason the love interest shifted towards Se Joon in the last 5 episodes. They didn't even have that many scenes together, let alone the none existent chemistry. Kang Ha Ri got robbed, barely any screen time and shitty love path.- Eun Hyang and Hwan Seung not ending up together is another random bullshit. Oh Yoon Ah put 200% in her performance."

It may make you question things especially how fast the progress is and the camera setting. The actors are really good and my favorite is Chang Ryul.

""Be My Dream Family"" truly defines what a family should be like despite of difference in opinions & personalities, least communication and distance. I watched this with lots of anticipations after finishing ""Once Again"" earlier this year and this, for my 2nd Korean soap opera, is very pleasing to me, if not as good as Once Again. Rather it has more realistic elements and less melo stuffs than Once Again. Soap operas with big fat joint family drama, do not have a solid plot development; instead a goal at the end, leading to a happy family life for everyone and this drama is no exception. Geum Jong Hwa & Kang Mo Ran are in their twilight ages and happen to be single when they meet each other as neighboring business owners. As they hang out with each other, both fall in love so much that decide to marry only after 6 months. Both of them have their big families already but now that they become family, they have a hard row to hoe in order to bring all of them together to one plate. The drama is about the journey of the family members going through various challenges in their personal lives as well as fighting among themselves, until they come to embrace various shades of each individual, finally accepting each orher as their own.Both the screenwriter and director have done a good job in this drama I swear, it's like developing a perfect partnership. The way the script is interlinked between different scenes and director's editing work upon that are very nice. For 80% of the story, one scene starts with a conversation on the topic upon which the previous scene's conversation had ended. The 120 episode dailysoap might feel a bit slow for the first 10 episodes but it definitely gets better as you watch further. There is almost no background score for majority of the drama but again, that's another feature of Korean daily soaps.Since soap opera family dramas don't have a solid plot, rather daily live happenings are showcased with an ultimate goal leading towards a happy family life, together, I don't there is much to talk about things. So let me just talk a bit about the characters. I loved the character development of all the characters...# Geum Jong Hwa: Lonely, aggressive old man to a loving father.# Kang Mo Ran: Loves and cares for every single family member and tries her best to bring everyone together despite problems.# Geum Sang Gu: Naive, jobless, family man to a good businessman. Loving husband & father.# In Young Hye: Responsible mother & wife who craves love. Becomes close to step-in-laws very fast.# Geum Sang Gu: Rude, arrogant drama PD to caring son and loving husband.Oh Min Hee: Ambitious actress coming back to industry after 20 years hiatus. Despite difficulties and public backlash she holds onto things and detrmines to do better. One of the best character development of the drama. Loved the way she changed over episodes.# Geum Sang Min: Twin daughter. Hardworking yet struggling & dirt broke artist of years. Becomes a better son.# Geum Min Ah: The 20yo SNU student, hardworking yet stubborn and does things without any thought. The cutest probably.# Geum In Sol: Twin Son. Another best character development. The 20yo guy was neither studios nor decisive. Clueless with what to choose, he tries various job in order to decide what he wants. Regardless, a very good son to parents who thinks clear and takes care of his family.# Han Geu Roo: 32yo single, with a closed heart. Protective of her family to a great deal and does a very good job work as an editor.# Han Da Bal: Widowed, a single mother and an amazing judo artist. Loves her daughter and family a lot but still not open to have another partner.# Min Ga Eun: Orphaned girl living with sister inlaw's family. Very ambitious at work and works hard. Soft-spoken and bubbly.# Min Sol: Thoughtful despite of her age, loves her mother a lot, loves to befriend everyone. # Choi Ji Wan: Divorcee, loving father, an amazing CEO of Aarang Publication. The humblest yet clueless. # Hyun Shi Woon: Temporary marketing head at Aarang. The friendliest and mood maker. A cupid to many lovers. Loved the way he talked.# Choi Yi Jae: Very shy kid, stuck between separated parents. Changes a lot by opening up to his father with Da Bal and Min Sol's help.# Ki Young: Physiotherapist, alcoholic, divorced, friendly yet hard to open up to. # Im Heon: 20yo brilliant student yet a stupid guy just like his wife, Min Ah. Causes trouble together.COUPLES:Jong Hwa & Kang Mo Ran: Married at their twilight years after falling in love. Becomes closer with time. Together, bring the 2 families together.Sang Baek & Young Hye: Felt in love in highschool, married despite situations, care for each other and together manage their small family. Concerned for their children.Sang Gu & Min Hee: Fall in love as asst. Dir. and rookie actress, marry after pregnancy. Maintain a bitter relationship but later turn in into a loving couple and embrace each other's flaws. Sang Min & Ga Eun: Formerly student & teacher, met each other after years as step families. End up staying under the same roof, working together and finally falling in love with each other.Geu Roo & Shi Woon: With a embarrassing first impression, both avoid each other at work but while helping Geu Roo as a cupid both fall in love unknowingly and faced difficulties to maintain it. Da Bal & Ji Wan: Both the single parents had to go through various challenges to end up together till the end because of their children , family and situations. It was like contrasting characters attracting each other.Min Ah & Im Heon: Married at 20 bcs of unexpected pregnancy. The cutest couple, both clueless and immature. Cause trouble for family but decide to do everything for their baby to come.So many important things anf factors of life at different places like home, education, workplace has been portrayed along with various aspects of life. A number of relationships and their various shades are beautifully represented. I am very glad after watching this drama.Many other things that's also been thrown light upon are: stress from study, early pregnancy, failed business, family responsibilities, alcoholism, fraudulent, cheating, extramarital affairs, highschool first love, dirty sides of entertainment industry, hatred & online abuse, sincere worker, struggle in performing and creative art sector, atmosphere in publication company, child mental health, divorcee life, widower life, love & care within family, understanding, privacy, concerns, etc.Ep 100-115 were the peak of the drama where life-changing events happened for most of the characters. It has literally everything summed up and despite many problems, the last 5 episodes ended the drama in a very good way. Loved it. I am happy I decided to watch it soon, bcs I don't really watch daily soaps (this is my 2nd). This drama brought out all kinda emotions from me and I was laughing, crying, smiling widely, cursing and all through out the drama. This drama is in fact more of a funny comedy and ngl, my laugh has become uglier after watching this TT. Korean daily soaps grow on you no matter how you watch it, ongoing or binging. PLEASE GO FOR THIS."

This show started out with SO much potential. It started off cute and funny with adorable leads that won my heart. Then about half way through, I started to worry. This is a 20 episode show and the story was starting to flounder. Surely, they will save it and all will be well - I believed this. And those leads - gosh, they are cute! Nearing the end, and I am really starting to get annoyed with Writer-nim. What the heck were you thinking Story-Writer??? And then the last episode comes, and I am so sadly disappointed in this show. If they had cut out most of the intense, glaring, staring contests maybe they could have written a tighter story. It's almost like the writer had so many ideas and tried to shove them all in to the show whether they fit or not. There were so many loose ends and ""what the heck"" moments that I could spend an hour listing them all. 

I cannot, in good consciousness, recommend this show to anyone. I really wanted to. I was smitten with Nam Goong Min and Min Ah - those leads were the bright spot in the pile of poo this story became. (And incidentally, this is the first time I've seen either of them act. I've not seen NGM do his villainous roles, but I think comedy suits him.) The story is named after Gong Shim. However, the title character doesn't seem to be the focus of the show in the back half at all. And her sister, who is on the cover as a ""main lead"" - is relegated to an afterthought. Her story goes NOWHERE. Joon Soo, the other main lead, was likable, but mostly boring. The writers essentially did nothing with his character. The focus of the show ended up with Ahn Dan Tae. They described one story to us, and we got something completely different. 

The ending was rushed and the last episode was completely and totally random and thrown together. I felt like they wanted to tie up a lot of loose ends, but they did not even do a good job of that. They had TWENTY episodes to finish this story. There was NO good reason that the ending should have been rushed. I feel sorry for the actors that were involved in this story. I would absolutely watch these actors do another show, and so wish that THIS story had been executed properly. 

The Good:
The cast 
The music
The comedic moments
The cuteness of the couple

The Bad:
The loose ends
The bait and switch story
The length
The unsatisfactory ending (happy ending, but not done correctly)

The Ugly:
Poorly executed storyline (throw it at the wall and see what sticks)

Unending glares and stare-downs

I originally intended to give this drama a score of 7 because I WAS entertained and enjoyed ADT and GS so much.

It was like sitting with friends and hashing out all the neighborhood drama that was going on, so it does not feel like a fast-paced get to the happy ending story.   Every emotion is dragged out.  At times it may feel like it is lagging.  It seems though that storyline changes were made somewhere along the way and it picks up as it progresses.   My rating is for the well developed characters and their relationships and the acting.  Story: So many issues in this.  I watched this as it aired.  So I had to wait for new episodes.  This was a good thing, because I got to savour the first couple episodes and let it marinate in my mind.  The societal issues that this show deals with are very timely.   The first couple episodes were a punch to the gut. I like romance and it took a couple episodes well for the show to set up and get to the romance.  But this did not deter my enjoyment, because the story was so good. That said: the romance of the two main characters alone is worth sitting through 100 episodes.  I did not like how the second romance line ended, but even in that it speaks to societal norms and a what the culture would accept as a suitable outcome. This story was real in only the way a Korean drama can do it.   So much commentary on how we live our lives, thought-provoking.  There is so much pain but so much love, all of it that makes up what our life is.  The show is aptly named. Acting/Cast:There were a couple annoying characters for me.  But as the story developed, I did not get to like them, but understood them and accepted them more.  The main male and female lead gripped me EVERY SINGLE TIME they were on the screen (Kim Jae Young and Seol In Ah)."

What are my thoughts about this drama... hmm.... honestly I am conflicted with myself as the story was pretty good, most of the acting was on spot and the drama did keep me on my toes wanting to see what would happen next. At times making it a clear candidate for a 9, 9,5  but at some point the twists became just a little bit too predictable. The mother a.k. main leads acting and dialog became cringe and annoying, and they kept giving the suspects a heads up so they could collude and destroy evidence to the point of just too much... The main family here is just a little bit to good, you know the type to be to kind, to perfect, to loving.. Though they do try to seem human they still end up a bit too much... However the friendship and the found family bits here are really good,. Again making me conflicted within myself since on the one hand I loved to see them develop and care for each other almost forgetting that even these so called overly perfect loving humans actually slapped kids out of frustration... People do not slap kids, especially if you are teachers! There are some good lines here and there, as well as thought provoking scenes, where they actually put the responsabilaty for the kids actions where it belongs! Not bad! There is also quite a bit of absurd humour done right but most of all a lot evil corruption etc done well.. yes I am a sucker for evil , I really am.. However once people start to repent here and there the plot loses its foremost charm as the good vs evil is kind of meeh... While the pure evil here is just gold! The villain played by Oh Man Suk   is so perfect! With flawless acting from his part leaving me 0 room to feel for him as he was truly as evil as evil gets. Making me appreciate him even more and though I can not put him on my crush list I feel I need to give him some love and maybe make a great villain actors list where he would be on top, yes that is how good he is at being evil. The kids acting here was also really good and each role was well balanced, well written and entertaining to watch!

The OST was refreshing and upbeat, which kept me tapping my foot to the beat while watching without being annoying. I really enjoyed the opening  song too! Seeing all the actors smile to the camera along with the song had me smiling too for some reason! I also didn't know so many actors I thoroughly enjoy were in this one drama, specifically, Kim Min Jae, Lee Yi Kyung (after seeing him in Go Back Couple and Euchalala Waikiki, I'll watch anything he's in!), Cho Hye Jung, and Choi Min Ho. After seeing all these familiar faces in just the first episode, I new I'd absolutely love something about the drama. By the end of the drama, I was left with some mixed feelings because there are some things that I wish were done just a little differently OR as least clarify some things by creating a sequel. I was so relieved and happy that the love triangle ended in the way it did, but I was also sad for the guy that didn't get the girl. I think I would have been left more satisfied if he had gotten some kind of happy ending rather than just him moving on in a bittersweet way. What made me so happy though about the love triangle resolution was that for once, the heroine wasn't jumping back and forth between men - she knew who she wanted and stuck to him and remained faithful through and through. And I respect the writers and the girl for that fact immensely. I think the writers could have simply improved the story (maybe by making the drama  a little longer or making a sequel) by giving the other guy his own happy ending. Something else I'd have liked to see was the side character's relationship blossom too. Those are the reasons this drama didn't get a 10/10 from me - I think there were some areas it could have been improved to take it up to a higher level of satisfying. Since it was such a quick watch and overall a good story, I'll probably rewatch it some day. An important thing to note is that this drama isn't really plot driven, but rather character driven, which I usually don't like. But for some reason, this story was written in such a straight-forward and quick-paced manner that I found it satisfying to (binge) watch."

Combinedly produced by Hi Ground, JS Pictures, and Great Story, Becoming Witch ( ) is a modern makjang-styled dark comedy drama with little mysteries. Written by Park Pa Ran and directed by Kim Yun Chul, the drama was broadcasted on TV Chosun.The story follows the wrecked married lives of three friends in their 40s, as they set to put an end to the aggravations in the already-frustrating situations when things become unbearable at a point. Gong Ma Ri (Lee Yu Ri) is a housewife, married to the star anchorman Lee Nak Gu (Jung Sang Hoon) and has a daughter, finds out about her husband cheating on her. Chae Hee Soo (Lee Min Young) is married to a rich household, and takes care of her bed-ridden mother-in-law, is unable to conceive and thus having a bitter relationship with her husband Nam Mu Yong (Kim Young Jae). Yang Jin Ah (Yoon So Yi), a widower, lives a luxurious life with the money she got from the life insurance after her husband Kim Woo Bin (Ryu Yun Suk)s death.Other familiar faces in the drama are: Ye Soo Jung, Kim Hyun Jun, Park Yoon Hee, Jung Ah Mi, Sun Byung Sook, Han So Eun, etc.Plot development was stable for the first half with several peaks which in the second half hit the shambles, particularly the last 3 episodes did dirty to the show. The beginning started impressive, it was a package of mixture of different elements: comedy, melodrama, melancholia, mysteries, etc. The progression was also a bit interesting as the two sides in the life of each of the 3 friends started going hard against each other. The problem was when all these soon escalated into the highest peak and it felt like they were quickly gonna run outta context, which actually happened.The debutant writer has way more to go and learn. They did a good job establishing the pilot episode and the follow-up by adding attractive elements like the badass female leads, their fashionable outfits, suspicious behaviors, and shades to their individual stories. I was glad at the fact that the character assessment for the leads have been kept brief while elaborating more on behavioral psychology. The downgrade in writing could be a result of inexperience in handling the stress or something, for which the show felt exaggerated with some repetitions and became boring in the 2nd half. The way major twists were unveiled was entertaining.I dont know the director nor do I can judge his style of working but this wasnt a good experience in overall. While the sound-editing and sequencing are up to par, the overall execution hits low by the end and the show stop making sense. The camera shots were likable ngl. There are 6 OSTs# Shut Up by Kim Boa# Kill My Love by City Noise# Every Morning by ID: Earth# Now or Never by Weki Meki# Ill Be With You Kim Bo Young# Take Me Home by NaviDefinitely not the best performance of Lee Yu Ri but this was a different kinda character from her previous roles and she aced it, every bit of it was interesting until the arc turned annoying. Happy for how Lee Min Young has improved and she carried out the misery of Hee Soo very well. Jung Sang Hoon was crazy.Oracles caf and the element of her being a badass feminist did intrigue a lot and loved it for sure. That part was exciting and thrilling at the same time.Final Remarks Pretty mediocre from every aspect, this drama pretty much missed the littlest of scope that could have been rethought and improved by the makers. The actors did their job but the lacking in the direction made it worse. My reason of starting this was the poster and Yuris look in it and was expecting something out of t but had t somehow finish the 2nd half for the sake of finishing. Not recommending even for one time watch."

Watched on Viki.Content Warnings: non con touching of his face (he was asleep/basically asleep?)What I Liked:- the intro song is upbeat and fun- the intro itself, glad they kept it short since the episodes are short- there was some nice chemistry between the designer and new model, would like to see these actors in something with an actual plot- the supportive dadRoom For Improvement- missing plot/choppy, what exactly was the contest at the beginning? Why does the designer have blood on his hands? What exactly was the relationship between the old model and the new model? What caused the scene that we saw on the stairs in the flashback? What is the significance of that ring? How did the designer and old model end up living together? Why does the designer ghost the new model in episode 7? Is the new model's mom dead? Did the designer actually not go to New York and then just didn't contact his lover for 1 year???? Ahhhhh!!!!!- odd things, people don't wait that long to say sorry, who touches a stranger's shirt like that? the short clip after the credits of the first episode but it wasn't a preview?  he didn't recognize him from the day before, they looked at each other a long time...- non realistic things, should have had the designs fall into water because they didn't really look very damaged, it goes from total daytime to night in 1 minute"

At first I thought Ma Tae Oh is the bad guy in the office but actually he's the one I like the most, despite his personal mistakes.

Lol.DislikesExcept for Tae Oh, all the other leads' stories are not that good. I don't like the tax guy, i prefer Jane with Jungdon not the the receptionist, even Hyunjoo lacked the spark of a young passionate agent. The weird sibling romantic vibes between Hyunjoo and Eungyul.The french drama has 4 seasons, while this remake's 1st season covered 2 seasons.

When it appeared in season 2 of Best Mistake, it was a little annoying but I felt like the main characters and their high school lives still had that light-hearted nostalgia. With season 3 kicking off with YD and HH broken up and with the addition of even more characters, it just felt like this season was rehashing the same old plots it had done before. The FL being locked in a dark room, being left on the side of a lonely street, being the subject of false rumors and photos...it's just all so overdone, even just in previous seasons. And having all this in the light of many second male leads being their typical soft and caring and heartbroken selves...it just highlighted the problems with how differently women and men are written.And so, the plot itself just felt very annoying, with many of it being triggered by these second female leads or being self-inflicted to make drama for the sake of drama, whether it was a miscommunication or simply questionable decisions. Even though the tertiary characters had less of this, there were far too many love triangles. I'm actually someone who typically enjoys them and the commentary about different ways to love  but that's only if done well. With all these characters starting to act very similarly and just being so bland, it felt unnecessary and like lazy writing. Love triangles are fine but there just has to be more to the characters than that.Even with all my criticisms, I appreciate the vibe and the style of the show. Visually it's bright and fun, and I loved seeing my favorite characters from Light On Me in a cameo."

This is the best detective thriller drama I have ever watched. There, I said it. How many of you have grown tired of watching crime shows that just don't feel exciting anymore? So many times, crime dramas get lost in the 'next big moment' and finding the thrill factor that they stop connecting with the watcher. Beyond Evil is a beautiful mix of emotion and supense. It's a blend of heartbreakingly slow, full of feeling moments and bone chilling darkness. It's not a super fast show. It takes its time as it unravels, develops and comes to fruition gorgeously- like a well simmered pot of stew. The drama's biggest strength is its unforgettable characters and the mindblowing acting by the cast. In the beginning it induces your trust issues in a gut punching manner by introducing its two seemingly morally grey and unreliable protagonists and then slowly but surely brings to light one of the best friendships the Korean cinema has ever seen. Both the main leads are phenomenal, each holding their own and being a massive force to be reckoned with. Shin Ha Kyun put out acting worthy of a Daesang. His reckless, passionate, wildly fearless and courageous detective with the biggest smile and eyes full of pain doesn't take long to cement his place in your heart. Yeo Jin Goo, on the other hand, while young, owned his role phenomenally. His character Han Joo Won, a prickly, seemingly cold catlike man with heart of platinum and a strong sense of justice is extremely easy to fawn over. Together, these two are a storm- infinitely badass with balls of steel; a dynamic team that you can't help but fall in love in with. Aside from the two, all the supporting characters bring their own flavour to the screen. While their little self-proclaimed 'Avengers' police team brings instant warmth to your heart, the antagonists are blood boiling-ly good in equal measure. The music is fantastic- sombre and dark at times; sometimes cheeky and playful and other times enough to wreck you. There are a lot of stunning shots and the drama is both extremely well written and directed. The character development is amazing and the bonds these characters form among each other is a powerful thing to witness. There's so much nuance in these relationships and it's hard not to catch feelings and let go of your heart when it comes to a show like this. Honestly, for me a good psychological thriller is hard to come by and this was by far one of the best. I was so invested in it that some of the scenes made me bawl my eyes out, while others made me laugh, giggle, swoon and shout HOLY FUCK at the top of my lungs. They nailed both the emotion and the 'whodunnit' aspect in a way that's very unique to the genre. It was a wild, crazy, full of thrill and heart ride that I almost don't want to get off of. Surely, a must-watch. Highly reccomended for fans of psychological thrillers who like their dramas with a little extra oomph!"

""Big Bet"" was inspired by the legendary persona of a South Korean casino manager who made it to the top of the multi-billion dollar casino world in the Philippines... until he was framed for murder.""Big Bet"" is another KDrama that has been divided into two halves in streaming provider style. (Unfortunately, this is kind of becoming the new KDrama fad and I'm already bored to express my anger about it.) Oh yes, and I'll say it in advance: if you're interested in the series because of Son Suk-ku, you'll have to stick with it for quite a few episodes - he doesn't appear until the end of the first season...The Disney production deliberately presents itself internationally. Nevertheless, one gets some atmospheric, socio-historical milieu impressions from South Korea - especially from the 1970s and 1980s, because the story is repeatedly enriched by flashbacks. (In fact, the first season is almost one great flashback - with flashbacks within that flashback, so to speak.) While the first season is designed primarily as a character study of Cha Mu-sik, the second season arguably has the real crime thriller behind it. Topic: Murdered South Koreans in the Philippines and the associated dynamic between the South Korean-born, now renowned casino manager, who has now become a murder suspect, and the investigator Oh Seung-Hoon, who was sent to the Philippines from South Korea. So the actual ""big bet"" only really becomes an issue in the second season.So what does the first season have to offer?Plenty of impressions of Mu-sik's childhood days, youth (wonderful: Lee Kyu-hyung as a youthful Mu-sik - although eventually Lee Kyu-hyung has meanwhile left his youth behind him...) and of his first professional steps into Casino world as young adult. The protagonist has his own charm and amazing talents and so we experience Mu-sik, although he radiates some sort of unapproachable aura, as an authentic and fascinating man with plenty of heart and mind, with a quick grasp, good intuition, radical consequence and entrepreneurial charisma.""Big Bet"" is a Korean-American production. It is international in its self-image and presents itself as such. It is made by men and it is about men. About smoking men. Sweating men in suits. Men with tattoos, too. The man with the most screen time is Oldboy Choi Min-sik (from the acclaimed 2003 K-Movie). He plays his role effortlessly as a 30-year-old and almost 60-year-old alike (thanks to modern filming and image processing technology). For ""Big Bet"" he is back in top form after a decade-long break. All in all,  in this KDrama we slide into a (conservative) world of men and gangsters. Their wives, if there are any, are at home with children and really don't know anything about anything. Exceptions are the wealthy, and due to her wealth influential CEO Ko (with a rather quick appearance but comparatively lasting impression: Lee Hye-young) and the young, by Korean standards sexually quite explicit, self-determined hotel employee Kim So-jung.In the flashbacks, as I mentioned before, there is South Korea at times. Nonetheless, ""Big Bet"" is principally based in the Philippines. Filming there took about 3 months. This promises exotic local hue, although the focus is on the casino and hotel world - which in turn could somehow be anywhere. No expenses were spared with the casting either. Even the supporting roles were selected with care.In short: ""Big Bet"" (Season 1) is a solid and ambitious character study of Mu-sik. His Story is told in a sophisticated way and staged well worth seeing. However, the series isn't really a KDrama-like KDrama. Anyone who likes a casino-gangster-crime atmosphere with an exotic ambiance will get their money's worth here. However, the story takes its time. It remains to be seen what the second half will come up with. I certainly have high expectation that ""Big Bet"" will even improve, now that Oh Seung-Hoon intrudes into Mu-sik's world with his investigations and thus will add further dynamic."

(I include the overall, which also includes S1 as well that I didn't make a review of)Plotwise... is what scarred me. This drama really focuses on the protagonist and his surroundings (connections between him and side roles). It loses some of the narratives with the little basic thing: how (origin on some side roles)? There's one scene (back from S1) that pretty much cringes, but basically the beginning of this trajectory of his journey that led into the climax. Speaking of the climax... leaves me a scar that I'd rather not disclose (see for yourself)Since this pretty much summarises how to build a casino empire and the fall of his lifetime journey, feels that it's missing something (thus, should be shortened to either 12eps or 8eps). Also, the director should build up some developments of roles that are essential (but cutting midway that I'm speechless). I agree with some viewers, it's lacking story, more action-packed ones; which of course, again, the enjoyment of guysI appreciate the realistic sentiment that has been invested in this, however, to me, it would be alright to turn back in time just to fix things altogether. In other words: the analogy of gambling is almost right in this story, but a little adjustment will bring exactly what viewers want"

This is probably Lee Jong Suk's best role to date. The very first episode will snare you like a mouse to a mouse trap, and youll find yourself wanting to see and know more. It was a fantastic setup.Not until you reached that last 10 minutes that you will realize how stupid (or incredibly smart) the creators must have thought of their viewers - that they thought they could wrap the whole 16 episodes in a few minutes. It just doesnt feel rushed, it felt like a betrayal of trust. In the risk of being spoilery, the ending felt very out of character for the main leads.

A few scenes and hanging threads were never explained, possibly only established in the hope that the series would garner enough attention to carry through with a second season, but we didn't come here for plot. We came here to achieve emotional healing from the comforting vibes of nature on display!On the one hand, an attempt is made to take four different people from different walks of life and demonstrate how plants can be a therapeutic part of the healing process for them. Together with their plants, they learn how to care for each other and themselves... and I am a sucker for a good found family, so this hit the spot. The genuine chemistry between the characters is wholesome and comforting.On the other hand, the in-universe therapy class is being pushed so hard that an unfortunate implication pops up - that horticulture therapy is a substitute for medical treatment - due to how some of the characters seek it out as a type of anti-medication solution to their very serious mental health struggles. Honestly, I can't say if this is the show's intention or if it was just another part of the attempt to show how this type of therapy can be a good choice for certain people. The short runtime of the series does it no favors by speedrunning the characters' recovery process so that if you aren't paying close enough attention it can feel like they're insinuating that plants and gardening are a miracle cure.Regardless, it is worth a watch if you like to see characters supporting each other through the healing process, don't mind the presence of a very subtly hinted at romance bubbling under the surface, can overlook some unanswered questions, and are curious to learn about some plants and the things that can be made with them along the way."

Kang Han Na should be the first choice. Maybe the second and third and even the fourth too. Shes a talent as an actor in general, but at this specific thing, shes unrivaled. That Bite Sisters asks her to do this on a frequent basis shows a keen sense of self-awareness, to both good and bad purposes.The cast is a legion of stardom for a web drama. Credits of the top four billed actors include a string of recent hit shows  like Crash Landing on You, Start-Up, My Roommate is a Gumiho, River Where the Moon Rises, Be Melodramatic and Mystic Pop-Up Bar. The production most takes place them in a fashion boutique giving the wardrobe crew license to deck the cast in some of the most fashionable threads the screen (web or otherwise) has seen this year. Now make the three female actors vampires to add a little supernatural twist and this well-known cast that looks amazing should be a slam dunk.A full length drama with sixteen hour long episodes can struggle weaving more than a single storyline and their supporting characters together coherently. In a web drama with only ten episodes averaging around ten minutes, its madness. Bite Sisters has a backstory, an arc where Yi Na (the main character played by Kang Han Na) blows up as an influencer on social media, theres the youngest of the three vampires Ji Yeon who has multiple issues at her job outside the boutique, Yi Nas old flame has been reincarnated, a cheating boyfriend of a customer, a young girl with a terrible father and even a neighbor lady thats trying to feed a street cat. Its a stew of undercooked, overused themes that dont really get any fresh treatment. Instead of a show about all of these things, its much closer to a show about nothing because none of the narratives end up with a fraction of the depth necessary to engage a viewer. Give it a good silent sideways glare because Bite Sisters is terrific eye candy. But its just a shiny veneer without any substance beneath the surface."

The first episode will grab you up and the second will confuse the caca out of you, but just keep watching as the writer delivers each piece of the puzzle bit by bit. Although, the story was not flawless by any means -- because there are definitely parts that didn't line up by the ending, it was still a crazy ride with interesting characters and a twisty plot that keeps you guessing and surprised until it's over. The episodes started to run pretty long at about an hour and a half, but I'm not even sure when that started. (So I would say that means I wasn't bored at all) I would say that the finale was probably the weakest episode, but that's all I can say without giving anything away. I would also say as a warning, a few episodes in this show may require a strong stomach. Also early episodes may also be better received if you have a bit of an appreciation for dark humor. So I'd only recommend it to those that don't have aversions to those things.I gave this show an 8 because it did not fail to entertain me and keep me hanging on to watch the mysteries unravel. I just can't bring myself to lower the score any further even with some of the uneven writing. This was my first time watching Song Seung Heon, and although I've heard some negative things about his acting, I thought he did a great job in this. Having watched Go Ara a couple of times, though, her acting I would say hasn't improved that much - or the character was just not written as well as they could have. I think the writers could have made her a stronger character. Overall the acting was done pretty well for most of the actors.I enjoyed the music in this and will probably search out the main song that played.The rewatch value could go either way. I probably won't rewatch anytime soon just due to the sheer length of this show and for the fact that now I know the plot. However, for some, maybe a rewatch would make seeing the pieces fall into place more enjoyable from the vantage point of knowing the final outcomes."

While the plot takes place in the school, its more about the politics that go into being a teacher and how the school is running as an institution. We dont get that many cute and lovable interactions between students and teachers, and its more focused on the power struggle between different departments, permanent and temporary teachers and other institutions involved in the education and internal struggles between doing what you find right and fitting into the environment.That said, its not all rules and cold politics. We get to know an amazing variety of characters, with different motivations, behaviors and ways of dealing with problems, and as we watch, we learn that at times there is no good nor bad decision, but rather a variety of different choices and all of them have some pros and cons to them. The few interactions between teachers and students are truly meaningful and add to the emotional depth this drama presents.I assume many people may not like Go Ha Neul since she at times acts really cute, unsure and innocent, but in my eyes she is actually a really strong character. With everyone saying she should not get involved or rebel against the system, she fights her battles and proves everyone wrong countless times. There is nothing wrong with being cute and strong at the same time. She wants to stay true to her beliefs, do whats best for students and survive in a new environment. She makes mistakes but is quick to admit to them and learn from them.The whole drama revolves around the daily struggles of realistic and complex characters with many flaws but even more good qualities. There are no really bad characters, just different people dealing with problems in different ways. While we might agree with some more than others, it's not hard to see the logic behind them all.This was truly an emotional ride, which made me laugh and cry many times. By the end, I loved so many characters I disliked at the beginning, and it was all possible because of the amazing writing. We either got fantastic character development or a deep dive into their perspective, which helped us understand their reasoning. While the plot was not the most complex and thrilling, the relationships built between the characters were all we needed to fall for this drama's charm.For whom: people who like complex and realistic characters, slow paced dramas that truly show problems from different perspectives, character driven dramas, beautiful cinematography.Who may not enjoy it: people enjoying a lot of action, overdramatic style of filming and dealing with problems, high school dramas that center around students and not teachers, people that get bored with politics and behind the scenes of a workplace, romance driven dramas."

It's going to take the first 5-6 episodes before you are up to speed with what's going on so stick with it, it's worth it.  The story is spread over two lifetimes, in the 1800's and in present day and I felt it was done so extremely well.  The story in the present day moves along as they then cut to scenes in history to provide back story at appropriate moments, which are then re-reflected on later to provide reminders so you don't need to be worried about ""how am I going to remember everything going on here?!"" .  I like stories that bring a mix of Joseon and modern day as I feel it adds extra depth and history to the story.Originally chose this one because of Shin Se Kyung having enjoyed her work in another drama and this only helped enhance my appreciation for her work. I did Initially think about dropping it simply because one of the reasons I am so interested in K-Drama's is to learn more about Korea and Korean history and this one kicks off in Slovenia. I don't have anything against Slovenia of course, and it actually does end up spend most of its time in Korea.  Ultimately I really appreciated the visuals and the contrasting scenes from Slovenia as well.Kim Rae Won, as the male lead, also pulled off the highly charismatic role brilliantly as well.  I found little to criticise in this one, it's a deeply emotional story that will have you reaching for tissues on a number of occasions and fill your heart with warmth on just as many.  You're going to really get involved in all the characters and their stories, their feelings and emotions and the long journey some of them have taken to be where they are, which makes even the ""bad"" character(s) such that you can empathise.I struggled with the ending to this one, it's nicely concluded but it left me a bit of an emotional wreck for a few days if i'm going to be honest.  I get it,  I love it - but line yourself up something warm and fluffy like What's Wrong with Secretary Kim as the dessert for this one.He was her black knight, on so many levels.

Upon paper, Blood actually has quite a good plot premise; vampires created in a   I am Legend - style way by infection (rather than the traditional manner in most vampire shows) , a protagonist infected since birth who wants to defy his fate and help others by becoming a doctor ,  as well as a female lead who actually had the potential to be a strong and independent asset within the show rather than just a mere love interest . Instead, there is a sense of discordance within the overall drama between  Ahn Jae- Sungs moping upon screen for nearly half the series around a hospital (which after the first few episodes no longer seem to  have something called   A and E or a regular flow of surgery operations )and Gu Hye Seon raising her voice as she flouts about the hospital stalking Jae-Sung as Yoo Ri Ta, without a second glance at the fact shes in a senior position and  in reality would be inundated in a pool of  work requests and submissions. It isnt  that Jae-Sung is a bad actor as hes proven his talents before in shows like The Beauty Inside (2018) as one of the  suave Male leads who was comically charismatic . Yet theres no sugarcoating that Jae-Sung s performance as Park Ji Sang was not one of his best and for a major proportion of the show, Jae- Sung came off as rigid and tight. Similarly whilst Gu Hye Seon is renowned for her performance in Boys Over Flowers (2009), she channelled her character, Yoo Ri Ta through a mixture of a deliverance of yelling her lines and stoic expressions as well. Admittedly  this also a  fault of  the director, the story writing  and characterisation  of the overall drama as well. Rather than directors Lee Jae  Hoon and Ki Min Soo pulling up Hye Seon and Jae- Sungs performances over minor errors in  earlier episodes to improve their  performances  and avoid later   mistakes, they seemed to be too obsessed with the thought of  trying to deliver a contemporary drama which they thought that Korean audiences would lap up after recent waves of western vampire franchises in Korea.  Yet the scriptwriters must also be put under the interrogation light here for their part as well in regards to the lack of characterisation and plot as well.  Rather than Park Jae Bum actually allowing us to see Ji Sangs own personal struggles as well as a sense of attachment towards Ri Tas own experiences as a development within their relationship, the scenes  that  viewers do see  moments of the past are neither talked about or mentioned again leading to a very rigid  romantic ( if you can call it that ) relationship between both characters for a major proportion of the show. Perhaps the one saving performance of the show was Jin Hee who was actually fairly good within his performance, however, the same cannot be said for his character Lee Jae Wook who had the potentially to be possibly one of the  most intriguing characters of the drama, yet typical to the cliches he was forced into a lacking sense of depth and purpose within the show. For most of Blood, Jae Bum seems obsessed with trying to cram in a myriad of  useless plot points amongst only a couple of useful ones before rushing to the action and ending by the finale. Rather than building or progressing the show over a course of sixteen episodes, theres little explanation or reasoning behind a lot of the events of Blood; presumably Ji- sang not ageing at the same rate of humans ( and if this applies to all vampires in the show), the actual motives behind our antagonist and of course what was up with the ending as well. It is wrong to say that Blood is entirely unwatchable as it did actually have some good points such as Kwon Hyung Sang as the much needed comical relief of the series ( for most of it at least)  and an intriguing plot premise, yet rather than Blood being one of the best cult classic Korean dramas of all time, its a farce of itself with  dire acting, directing and writing.

The focus eventually shifts to the intense battle between Heo Joon Ho & Park Sung Woong's characters, with the latter being the villain. Both characters are determined to dismantle each other's gangs & inadvertently Both Male lead characters gets entangled in this conflict.The action sequences were exceptionally well executed & exhilarating, although at times, the story might lose its momentum & become a bit monotonous.I want to point out that this drama has a lot of violent scenes. If you're not fond of bloody violence, it might not be the best choice for you.I initially loved the brotherhood between the two male leads but as the story progressed, focus shifted more towards the main plot & bromance took a backseat. Numerous new characters were introduced & received significant attention, which overshadowed the bond between two male leads. Be prepared for the deaths of important characters throughout the drama. If you're not emotionally prepared for such sequences, you might want to skip this series.In terms of acting, performances were outstanding across the board. Both main characters & even minor supporting roles delivered fantastic portrayals.The action heroes were amazing in this drama & their performances were truly impressive. The action scenes were so intense that they made me really excited.Episode no.6 & 8 were absolutely mind blowing & most thrilling of the whole series.

(Source: AsianWiki)","Choi Ri, Heo Sung Tae, Jang Hyuk, Kang Han Na, Lee Joon, Park Ji Yeon",KBS2,"Stunning visuals and the thrilling game of wits.  Your expectations will make or break this show. If you expect a typical noble king versus corrupted officials power struggle, this will be a huge disappointment. You need to be aware of the fact that for a lot of the show the king takes the side lines in this power political scheme and the focus is put on other main characters and the overall context of the current court situation. Lee Tae for many episodes is shown being too preoccupied protecting Yoo Jung taking detours in his plan. This is not a story of a hero fighting for power to create a better world. This is a story of a king with no vision, trying to gain power for the sake of power. A king who is willing to sacrifice many innocent lives and put the whole country in danger for his personal goals. A king who, while possessing some wits and strategy skills, has no wisdom and is unable to foresee the consequences of his actions. A king who should never be a king (until they give him last minute change of heart, I don't want to talk about it...)While most of this review is my personal subjective interpretation (which mostly talks about the events excluding the last episode, as I feel like ot did disservice to the whole show) of the events and the characters, it is a fact that this is not the good versus evil type of a story. Its a great portrayal of the aftermath that could happen in the country after deposing a tyrant king. Putting a new one on the throne is not the end of the struggle, Its just the beginning. The subject and officials learning how to trust the new ruler, and the new king proving his worth and gaining power with their wisdom and not the political schemes would be the ideal scenario, which could not be more different than what the drama presents. The new king tries to gain more power against the officials. The officials fear the tyranny they just ended, so they try to limit the power of the royal family. The royal family works even harder to gain more power. Both sides started to use evil tactics to achieve their goal. No one is right, no one is good. To understand the motivations of the characters you need to take into consideration the context the drama sets. Lets start with the characters, as they are the core of this story. Before you proceed though, know I am a pro Gye Won type of a girl. Lee Tae and his family reminded me of all the evil royal families in all chinese dramas - creating a mess because of their bad planning and actions, and then blaming other people for them. No one was willing to be accountable for what they have done. The late Queen would rather die a queen which led to many innocent lives being sacrificed, than lose the honor. The late king would rather put the blame on innocent people for her death, instead of telling the truth. Lee Tae would rather risk the whole countrys safety with his poorly planned schemes (I mean, dude was surprised Queen Dowager turned into a full tyrant after he led her to take over the lack of insight was amazing) than put in the effort to unite the people.And none of the Lee Taes family members had a real goal, except gaining power and honor for the royal family. The country was not in chaos. People were not living bad lives, the officials (while there will always be some bad apples) were not all corrupted groups who used their power for their own benefit. Yes, they limited the royal family, but they did it out of fear, not out of greed. And The royal family did nothing to make the officials trust them. Who decided to make a queen a daughter of the killed tyrant and then act surprised when officials start to be more on edge? Lee Tae was not fighting against the bad guys, he was fighting for power, and thats where his plan ends. He never presented any ideas of how he will use said power to make the lives of his subjects better, how to make the country stronger. From episode one they showed countless hints how he is in fact a tyrant in making, even though being one was never his actual goal. Throughout the show he kept seeing himself as a victim and justified all his actions. In his mind, the people that died because of his schemes were not victims of his ploy, they were sacrifices he made. But he failed to see that one cannot sacrifice what is not theirs, and their lives were not. One can scarify THEIR life, THEIR dignity, THEIR possession. Taking it away from other people for your own gain is NOT sacrifice. I think from the start we saw how he was not fit to be the king. The more episodes I have seen, the more on Gye Wons side I was, even though he himself was nowhere near being a hero. With how the story was told, it made complete sense that he tried to keep the royal familys power in check after surviving the tyrant king, especially since Lee Tae never showed any signs of possibly doing a better job at ruling. He was pretending to be a foolish king not interested in politics, so why would Gye Won put the trust in him? And when Lee Tae finally started to make some moves, they were all focused on fighting against the officials, and none on trying to make the country a better place. We saw how Gye Won was willing to give up his power as long as someone shows the qualities of a good ruler - putting the people ahead of their goals, plans, honor and pride. The moment he saw Yoo Jung has these qualities, he was willing to serve her and respected her plans and decisions she was making. He was supporting her and trusted her. Gye Won became one of the most interesting characters in all 2022 dramas. At first it might seem as if his goal of putting the righteous king on the throne is just a way of keeping the power to himself, as no king will ever meet his arbitrary ideals, but later on we can see thats not the truth. He was never loyal to the royal family, he was loyal to the country. He was willing to sacrifice his life, and in consequence dooming his whole family, just to make sure no tyrant will ever gain the absolute power. He went against the love of his life the moment she seeked the power she should not have. He was willing to lose all his merit, honor and pride, becoming a traitor if it meant saving the country. Truth to be told, both Lee Tae and Gye Won did some shady things during the drama. The difference here is the motivation - Gye Won was fighting FOR the country, while Lee Tae was fighting AGAINST the officials. One had a vision of a prosperous country in mind, the other had a vision of absolute royal power. One was willing to sacrifice themselves for the country, while the other was willing to put the country in danger for his goal. It became a question - what makes a good king? Political strength of the royal family as Lee Tae wanted? Or wisdom and benevolence that Gye Woon sought in the new king? And then we had the brilliant Yoo Jung. While the first 4 episodes made her seem like nothing more than just a love interest for Lee Tae and a pawn in political schemes, she quickly became one of the sources of power in the court. Compared to Gye Won and Lee Tae, she, from the start, used her own wits, at times putting her own life at risk, instead of using people around her. She was able to gain the trust of both Gye Won and even the most trusted person on Lee Taes side, to help her with her plans. She knew when to compromise for the good of the people, putting her own wants to the side. Since her goal was to protect the people, fighting against others was not always her go to opinion, as it more often than not created more victims. She tried to negotiate and find a common ground. As a true ruler should. Her trust in Lee Tae by the end of the show was a bit delusional, I have to admit it. Her trying to whitewash his crimes, acting as if he was different than Queen Dowager or Gye Won was simply laughable. Stating that he will not take the same path that Queen Dowager took, when he was the one who created the path himself was just painful to see.The complexity of the characters and the no obvious morals were the best part of the show. Putting a complete twist to the typical court period drama was a delight and got me engaged on some next level. I was analyzing and discussing the characters and their actions with many users after each and every episode, and they always left me with some issues and ideas to reflect upon.All that said, the show is not without flaws in terms of the characters and writing. The biggest issue I had was Queen Dowagers characterization. I honestly had no issue with her becoming just a pawn in the game. She was never shown to be a witty, smart and driven person. From the start she was passive and relied on Gye Won to make all the decisions. What bothered me was her motivation which made little to no sense. They did not set it properly. Yes, I understand that her fear of abandonment made her seek the power, but with how she was presented, her reasoning behind it should be I will give you the country to rule, you dont need Yoo Jung instead of I will take away everything you have and burn the country you tried to protect. Her out of the blue defiance and war against men in power was just laughable, because nothing about how she was presented before fitted that scenario. Another character that had questionable presentation was Jo Won Pyo. I understand that he was supposed to represent a person who goes with the flow does not fight for nor against to keep themselves safe. I understand its supposed to give us the viewers commentary on how not standing up against evil does not mean you are neutral, it means you are on the side of the bad guys, as it supports their actions. I dont think they truly delivered that message well. We knew from the start that he and Gye Won worked together to depose the tyrant king. We know he took the right actions when needed, so this will he/wont he closer to the end seemed a bit out of place. Whats more, the show relied a little bit too much on surprising reveals to deliver impactful plot twists, which led to sacrificing some character development and limiting the attachment the viewers might have had. Some of these tactics worked well - Yoo Jung deciding to stay in the palace against Lee Taes wishes. It was a short, one episode side story, did not take a lot of the screen time and with all the other information we had about Yoo Jung, did not impact how viewers saw her in terms of her wits and intelligence. We knew she was smart, we did not need the step by step explanation on how she did it. On the other hand, they tried to use the same style of storytelling for some longer plotlines, and that just failed. Im not the biggest fan of making Lee Tae the mastermind of it all in the last 4 episodes, when he was presented as a smart, but impulsive and emotional person during all the previous ones. My issue was the fact he was shown to behave like that even when there were no people around him, when he did not have to pretend for his plan to work. I honestly felt lied to. The direction of the plot was brilliant, but the writers trying to keep it hidden for so long was not the best choice for me. Same story happened with the young monk - with how much of an impact he had on the plot, we knew nothing about him, he was added to the plot in later episodes. Before we could try to understand him and his motivation, he was gone - a painful case of a character being just a plot device and nothing more. Some people might also dislike how the schemes were mostly just talking and plans, and close to none of them actually happened, as they were stopped or negotiated before they took place. It was not - kill, poison, lie, hire assassins, over the top type of political schemes. It was far more based on the game of wits, threats and mutual convincing that the actions someone wants to take will not be beneficial, as the other person might have hidden some tricks up their sleeves. One could say the plot is slow and barely anything happens. Its true that there are just a few big events. The plot is the shifts in dynamics and creating new alliances. The core of the show are the characters, not the plot itself. Why do they do what they do? What do they stand for? What are they willing to do to achieve that? Whom should the viewers root for? Whats worth mentioning are the visuals of the show. The whole show is like a moving painting. The number of breathtaking scenes was high. Some of my favorites were the aerial shots - Im a sucker for these. If dramas have them, I will always give some bonus points. This is for sure the most visually stunning drama I have seen in 2022. And these visuals are supported by the amazing soundtrack. While I loved all the songs, the instrumental arrangement had more impact for me. The acting was almost perfect. I cannot stop myself from thinking Lee Joon exaggerated some line delivery. Especially when he added that raspy quality to his voice every time the character got angry, sad or emotional - after a while it became just too much. Instead of getting emotionally affected by the scene, I was thinking how much his throat has to hurt after all that. I was also not amazed by Choi Ris acting as Jo Yeon Hee. Even though the character was rather unlikeable, I felt indifferent because of the portrayal. All the rest of the cast did amazing. Jang Hyuk is an actor that was born to act in period dramas, so no surprise for her. That one that caught me off guard with how well they did was Kang Han Na. She is an amazing actress, but the role of Yoo Jung was extremely hard to deliver correctly. Being both strong, but also delicate. Empathetic, but also assertive. Emotional, but also rational. Give that role to a worse actress and the character will be all over the place. Kang Han Na aced the role and made Yoo Jung one of my favorite female characters. I honestly don't even want to talk about the ending. Pacing wise it made no sense for any of the characters to do a 180 like that.  If they wanted this conclusion, the events in episode 15 should have happened at least 2 episodes earlier, so the change would be more gradual. My issue is not even the ending itself, but how it was delivered.Overall, you can enjoy the show if you just casually watch it, but the true value comes from truly analyzing it and trying to understand the characters and context of the show. The more you invest your attention and time into this show, the more you will enjoy it. It leaves you with many moral questions that are truly not easy to answer."

When they become adults and the main stars take over, it's still alright for a while... then about 12 episodes in, the second lead actress (the villain) gets injured and they cast someone else and it seems like they rewrote it so suddenly she's the lead, not Lim Ji Yeon. That's where it took a really noticeable downturn. I get that they were in a hurry and needed someone who could handle a role that was aggressive and selfish and such, but it's like the contract they signed with her had some clause that she had to get at least 35 minutes of each hour on average. Maybe they started like that, but if that's the case, make the villain the lead. The leading lady is a total doormat, something I hate because no one is going to just put up with being kicked around-they'll either run away or they'll fight back be it in a drama or real life, at least when it's to this degree of emotional abuse, manipulation, etc. Ugh. Anyway, I really don't advise anyone to watch this unless they take sick satisfaction in seeing someone trampled all over at work, by her mother in law (here, it's tradition for the daughter in law to do the prepping of all 100 cabbages for kimchi making!) who still after marriage wanted to split them up, even...

Yet the immediate status around idol actress Yeri  (   Red Velvet) being cast as lovelorn female lead Oh Ha Rin, has undeniably attracted the  web series to receiving  hype . On a strong note Yeris acting is pretty solid here. She has a vibrant ambience around her character, immediately dragging viewers into sitting up and paying attention  to the storyline. As it has been said beforehand, there is no beating around the bush that  Blue Birthday is a fairly  seen and done concept, but this doesnt mean that the director isnt willing to try something new either.  Park Dhan Hees cinematography was really mesmerising in a lot of shots. You could tell by the array of palettes,  the pathetic fallacies  that the director was trying to convey. Light hues of daylight  could animate Ha Rins jovial mood , whilst darker, moody blues of the sky, a room or the rain brought the scenes surrounding Seo Jun ( Hong Seok)s death or Ha Rins bereavement into a more hard-hitting and colder reality. Yet  Blue Birthday can truly be defined as a mixed party bag of flaws also. Whilst Yeris acting was decent, her fellow costars often struggled to pertain the same level of solidity over the course of sixteen episodes. Not unwatchable, just certainly not bringing these characters to life either. Admittedly this wasnt entirely the fault of the cast as character writing could also be a  cataclysmic problem with the mini series also . This is mainly because none of the characters ( including our mains) really seem like everyday people. Now it is arguable that this is the point of the series; it is a fantasy-romance mini series about two teens in high school and so nothing regarding their personal lives outside of this main plot is that important . On the other hand what makes a character feel relatable and real is drawing parallels and similarities with our own lives by their interactions and relationships with other characters which whilst it did exist, was only really shown to make the storyline move or crack into some  comic relief moments.Again its wrong to entirely condemn the series here. There was some surprising twists and revelations with Seo Juns familial background which played a major part in unravelling the enigma of his death, as well as adding angst-ridden chemistry to Seo Jun and Ha Rins onscreen potential relationship. On the other hand whilst Seo Jun was a useful plot device to keep the mini-series storyline  on its feet, its hard to truly define Seo Juns greater calling as a character by his build-up, typically revolving around school ( rather than the series gradually building this up through small revelations of his family life) and his potential romance with Ha Rin. Sadly similar to Seo Jun was Ha Rin. Whilst its understandable that her main goal was to save Seo Jun through her Groundhog Day setup, it was baffling that Ha Rin seemed to have little interaction or revelations about her relationship with family or   a personal past problem during this period that she wanted to focus on as an individual. To explain this further its fair to say that weve all made personal mistakes in the past and most likely often wish we could change them. Arguably part of Ha Rins great mistake is the feeling of letting down Seo Jun by being unable to prevent his death. Thats understandable and what made her grief resonate with audiences, but thats also only necessary to the major plot line. Rarely do we see or delve into Ha Rin diverged subjective regrets on a personal level either with friends or others also. In terms of our antagonist ( and without spoilers), it is fair to say that the storyline indicates subtly but early on through portraying this character in a negative light towards the true villain. Are they well-written? This character really just serves one purpose and that is to be a  plot device to  add tension and drama to the series. Whilst they do have some motives, theyre mainly disregarded and rarely fleshed-out in order to paint this character as  being evil for the sake of evil. Not entirely terrible for the pragmatic  purpose of the drama, but certainly fitting more into the  moustache twirling villain category than complex. On more nuanced note,  there are also some seriously questionable  moments within the dramas writing logic that made little sense realistically in the drama  such as Ha Rin ( despite being a fairly witty character when she wants to be) talking in a public place about a key plot revelation which couldve easily put her in further danger ( and refuses to acknowledge further risks) or liability for her previous fatal mistakes , the main villains classic mistakes which couldve been easily picked up upon earlier,  the incompetency of the police ( including lack of DNA testing) and of course the shift between the present and a decade  ago for Ha Rin not  feeling that significant for  viewers. It is arguable that perhaps the screenwriter was trying to show this from Ha Rins perspective by this suddenly becoming part of her normal everyday life. However for Ha Rin this is also a nostalgia trip down memory lane of her teens. It would have been understandable if small passing popular cultural references, slang, technology or  fashion had brought it home for Ha Rin ( and viewers) towards being in the past. Instead it was hardly to truly grasp when we were stepping back in time. Aside from a quick wardrobe and makeup styling change for Yeri which was meant to indicate;  Oh, Yeri had on a school uniform, and schoolgirl bangs. We must be in the past again.In conclusion Blue Birthday wasnt an unwatchable mini-series. The ending was decent enough and in between  aesthetic cinematography shots, Yeris performance and the plot premise as well as the mysterious events surrounding Seo Juns demise in the storyline remained enticing factors for watchers. On the other hand, the screenwriting with characters, mismatched  dialogue and logic as well as the acting and pacing remained the mini series greatest downfalls. This was  certainly not a  terrible  with an easy amount of fluff and darker themes to keep you watching , but not without its evident inconsistencies either."

With 11 episodes of about 12 minutes each, the series was beautifully developed and delivered with just the right pacing. I loved that almost all scenes (and characters) felt important with minimal fillers, sprinkled with just the right amount of cuteness, sillyness, adult kissing (and lovemaking) and a few obligatory shirtless trap scenes.It also doesnt hurt that we got two very good looking and capable leads. Im not sure if it was intentional but the awkward acting of Jo Kyuk Joon somehow worked for his mysterious emo character, and Kang Eun Bin is like a younger Kim Min Jae, and i mean it in a good way. On the other side, the series reminded me of the anxieties i felt  while watching all other beauty transformation series that tried to deal with leaving an old life behind and trying to live with a somewhat fake  beautiful identity to get acceptance - only this time, we see it from a  guy's point of view. Or are we?Cha Si Won can be played by a male or female actor without needing to change any of the script. The series was trying to say love is love and it has no gender, by emitting (or ignoring) any mention of homosexuality. However that for me was the weakness of the show - because in reality, same sex relationship isnt all rainbows and butterflies, and it could have added another layer to the love story of SiWon and Da Un. There are so many BL series nowadays who prefer to take this route and to be frank, it acts as a double edge sword that can sometimes work but sometimes can undermine serious gender issues and over romanticize the idea of an unconditional love. The fact that they showed the mother feeling scandalized by being portrayed as a bad mother and yet has no concern about having a kid being in a same sex relationship, may prove to be a  little too unrealistic and unrepresentative of the situation on the ground. To be honest, what we have here is a shortened watery version of My ID is Gangnam Beauty.Would i reccommend? Yes, definitely."

Not just in K-drama land, but in the entire world and in history.Maybe it's too early to claim that, but 6 episodes in, and it's very evident already.They let us see up close and personal what a person who loves someone so much, have given them everything, feels like and goes through after a nasty break-up, (specially because of cheating).They did not rush the story. It was paced well, to bring out the emotions, the pain, the hurt. The psychological impact, and ultimately, how a person can get back on their feet.The monologues were awesome as well. Every single one of it were felt. They showed us the process.And as someone who have been in such a situation, Yoo In Na captured everything so well. Did she experience it herself? Because gawd, that was me. Desperate. Shaking. Hopeful. End-of-the-world. Will take all the blame, will even take the blame for killing Abel, or Julius Caesar. Will turn a blind-eye. Will even accept sharing your partner! Because at that moment, you're thinking you can not live without them.You can not accept the new reality in front of you. You want to move on, but the new reality is unrealistic. You are not in denial anymore (otherwise you wouldn't even beg), you just do not want to embrace your new reality.

Will they manage to escape the past, or be forced to come face to face with it?(Source: Viki)","Choi Kwang Il, Jang Ki Yong, Jin Se Yeon, Jung In Kyum, Kim Jung Nan, Lee Soo Hyuk",KBS2,"I loved this drama.  I find it so sad and telling that so many people didn't.  I'm sorry that it's so hard to follow for some people.   Perhaps it shows the dismal literary education given in public schools nowadays...As another person said, this tale is reminiscent of the Bronte sisters - as of course the writers throw in viewers' faces through out LOL  I wonder how many of those watching EVER read Wuthering Heights? At any rate, those pretending our heroine didn't grow weren't paying attention.  She was misled from the very beginning about the characters of both these men, which led to her making the original choices she did.  Her original self never questioned her perception of reality, dying without truly understanding either man. I have to interject here that I think the 1980s version of our detective, despite what we find out in the last episode, was basically a good, decent man who would have been horrified by his reincarnated self's actions.  In fact, when that prosecutor decides to redeem himself, I think it's because he did get his memories of his previous incarnation back.  I had been totally in sympathy with our 1980s detective, but when he reappeared as that self-righteous prosecutor, so willing to bend the rules and manufacture evidence just because HE had decided someone was guilty?  Oh, no.  Hated him and even wondered if HE was the reincarnation of the supposed serial killer.Speaking of that tortured soul of a '2nd lead' ?  Well, HE had been led around by the nose by that father of his!  I'd been convinced that he'd hallucinated his father, at first - that he'd killed his abusive father & then developed 2 personalities.  I kept that idea for at least a third of the drama because the writers did a very good job of leading us down that rabbit hole!  Another red herring - at first it seemed as if our heroine had gotten the heart OF that 'murderer'.  Now, our leading lady is not as quick to judge as her previous self.  She does think about things more thoroughly, without accepting everything at face value.  She lets herself get drawn in by our prosecutor, but she hasn't a clue about his real character in the present.  With our reincarnated 'murderer', however, she does gradually find out what he's like - she's drawn to him because she feels pain & pity every time she sees him.Those people whining about 'stalker stalker' - BOTH these guys 'stalked' this woman, you know.  Also, it was out of fear for her safety, not out of some 'stalker perversion'.  But some people simply fail to see nuances at all.Bottom line, the entire drama shows how the main female lead slowly figures out the TRUE characters of both these men, and also which one cares deepest for her, and also which one SHE truly cares most for!  I found this journey to be somewhat hard to follow at times, and some questions remain unanswered (our detective from the 1980s didn't die from being knifed - those guys in black suits came & dragged him off somewhere, & bashed his head in with a rock - this NEVER gets addressed properly).  Also the whole 'switching of the artificial insemination donor' is just brushed off a bit too easily.  However, I did indeed like the ending - found it satisfying.  Our reincarnated heroine put her past behind her, knowing that she'd not been fully informed in that life, and faced the future with the man who truly loved her enough to die for her (while giving her to his rival).  That's just soul-fulfilling."

She then became a widow...(Source: AsianWiki)","Jung Il Woo, Kim Tae Woo, Ko Dong Ha, Kwon Yu Ri, Lee Jae Yong, Shin Hyun Soo",MBN Viki,"I thought that after Vincenzo ended that it would take me a while to find another drama that I would enjoy as much, but it turns out that Bossam: Steal the Fate was exactly what I was looking for. Its been a long time since Ive been so into a sageuk. I have enjoyed many of these light, very polished and colorful period dramas that we have had lately, but Bossam feels a whole lot mature and more serious than many of the those. It felt so refreshing and something very up my alley.The drama wastes no time and the plot starts immediately. It manages to introduce us to the characters and show us the dynamics between them as the plot moves along at a brisk pace, before slowing down a bit towards the middle. The first half of the drama focuses a lot on the characters and their relationships. You are drawn into the story through them. The characters are all rather well ingrained in the story and well-rounded.I enjoyed seeing a story about the common people and people outside the palace. We dont get a whole lot of that in sageuks. I could watch them just do the dishes and chat and do the housework for about twenty episodes I think. This small, quiet home life and everything that came with it was one of the strongest parts and the charm of this very character-driven drama.The romance here so incredibly slow and full of yearning and longing. Its not going to be for everyone, but for me it actually hit a really sweet spot. This is also such a well executed fake marriage and found family trope. Even though the drama is constantly separating the main couple, or they do not express their love very much and the wait for the kiss is very long, it never seems too forced and you can really feel the love between the main characters even though they do nothing but look at each other with mellow eyes.I must admit that I have not been this enthralled by a romance in a drama as much for a long time. Most of the time I like, or enjoy the romance. But there is something about this longing and yearning and kindness that is between these characters that completely makes me melt. It does something for me. I just did not get enough of the main couple. Longing and yearning and this rather quiet love is something I really enjoy.Jung Il Woo really suits sageuks and Yuri is really good in this role. This is her best acting performance to date. There is a really good spark and chemistry between them and I think the character they play feel sort of refreshing in this genre. Although there some side characters who feel like these typical sageuk characters the actors (as well as the script) managed to make them fun and interesting. Soo Kyung is really prim and proper in her demeanor who wishes everyone well but she was never put in the background or anything, like a lot of female character do in their sageuks. The story was just as much about her as it was about Ba Wu.The romance is slow burn, but the story also feels a bit slow and has a habit of repeating itself a bit, or it goes back and forth a bit, but its also such a character-driven narrative so it feels like normal progression within the story. And I think it has something to do with how good the character are and that you understand the reason for their actions. The story seems to flow with them and their decisions rather than the character moving as the story wants them to.Towards the middle the drama goes that traditional we have to go to the capital route which does crop up all the time in sageuks that takes place in the countryside. It tends to dampen the story a bit and give the viewers something completely different than the story seemed to promise, but personally I found that change in Bossam rather natural and although the story focuses a little more on the palace politics in the second half of the drama I felt it never completely takes over the story or comes out of the blue.I felt it was nice mix of the very slow-burn romance of the main characters, their home life and then the politics that is there to add a more more drama into the story. Personally, though, Im rather fond of palace politics so it could have an effect on my enjoyment of that portion of the story.Bossam could very well end up being my favorite drama this year. From the romance, to the cute found family and a really cool character-driven story that never went too far ahead of itself or was trying to be bigger or more impressive than it was, it managed to tick so many boxes from me. I really enjoyed following these characters. It seemed so mature and down to earth and there was something pretty classic-sageuk about it. This is a sageuk drama that I had been waiting for for a long time."

But don't worry, it's not meant in a bad way. It just has the same vibe. Also, so far tvn's dramas have never disappointed me yet. So, neither has this one.

The story evolves around this guy that can see ghosts and even touch them - therefore also fight them as they continue to bother him through his daily life. There then he meets this female student ghost who gets on bad terms with him, but in the end ends up fighting other ghosts together with him.

Most times the story is held lighthearted, although the ghosts appear to be really scary sometimes - remember the movie ""The Grudge""? You'll certainly encounter some of those while watching the drama. But in the end every one of their unique stories seem rather pitiable or just sad than frightening and sometimes have a deeper meaning to it.

The acting was solid, convincing and also charming at some points. The fights were really good, enjoyable and even funny. They did a pretty good job on those. Also, CGI effects thumbs up. Quite the sight here. So, when it came to those dramatic scenes, they pulled those off really well.

When it comes to the final, be prepared. Suspense, intensity, thrill... you'll get everything. The whole story isn't stalling one bit but has a smooth flow and the way the mystery surrounding the leads is unraveling only bit by bit, keeps the tension.

So, like I said in the beginning: Recommended if you look for something like ""The Master's Sun"" or ""Oh My Ghost"". Have fun watching it if you haven't done it already ;)"

What I liked:1)The actors playing the younger Ri Hwan and Haeng Ah.  Their story lines were interesting, and they did a good job.  Episode 11 was good, we got to see the leads as their younger selves.2)I suppose all of the actors did a good job with what they had to work with.  It wasn't the actors themselves, but the characters that I had a hard time with.3)Episode 15.  Nice tie up and it would have been a good ending here.Things that made me want to scream:Let's start with the characters.  1) Ri Hwan appears to have cared for Haeng Ah forever.  He was always there to pick up the pieces when her life fell apart, but never put himself out there.  Then there's the fact that he was TOO nice.  There was a girl that liked him (why?), she was basically a stalker, she knew that he liked someone else, but he kept meeting her and then he apologized to her?!?!2) Haeng Ah - puts up with (and lives with) a man that completely ignores her, shows no emotion toward her, and can't even really have any kind of a deep conversation with her.  She decides that she's had enough, breaks up with him, yet keeps meeting with him.  Apparently, I was so irritated I started micro-watching, because her rings were driving me up the wall.  Why do you need one on every finger?3) Seok Joon - aforementioned boyfriend of Haeng Ah.  This character had no personality at all.  Completely flat affect throughout the entire drama, until one slight movement toward a grin in the last episode.  She breaks up with him, he knows why, you know he has no intention of changing, yet still keeps coming around.  Stalker much?  Watching him was creepy and depressing.4) Ye Seul - the girl that likes Ri Hwan.  Again, this character had no emotion, other than depression, throughout the entire show.  She even says that people ""say I'm like misery"".  True words.  She knows he doesn't like her, that he likes someone else, yet uses emotional blackmail to be with him ""I'll get the best care for your mom if you'll be with me.""5) Haeng Ah's mother - she was terrible at the beginning of the story line wanted us to feel bad for her, but in some ways, it was too little, too late.  Those were my main issues.  Then, you add to the fact that there were entirely too many story lines going on.  Multiple couples, used-to-be couples, almost couples.  Not enough time was spent developing a really good story for any of them.Story:At about episode 5, Haen Ah and Ri Hwan finally admit their feeling for each other.  But by episode 7 she is waffling.  They break up in episode 8 and there is abject misery all around until the very end of episode 13.  The reasons for the breakups are weak, and there are numerous opportunities for the 2ML and 2FL to try to inveigle their way into the leads' hearts/lives.  It was so irritating and unnecessary.   I really disliked both second leads, and the fact that the leads kept meeting up with them made me dislike the leads as well.  So, the leads were actually apart more than they were together, and I didn't feel chemistry between any of the characters.  Episode 16 was just filler.Music:There was some song that was repeated multiple times and the beginning of it sounds like Jingle Bells, which totally took me out of the story.I know that a lot of people really liked this drama, lauding it as having an Indie feel about it.  In layman's terms, that just means that the story was slow.  Which isn't a bad thing in itself, provided the drama is well-written and that you like and root for the characters.  I was just counting down the episodes until I could be finished."

But when it comes to protagonists' actual backstories, to begin with, I find it still lacking until the end of the story. The overall cast did an amazing job, but a decent plot; so does cinematography (I appreciate again so thank you very much). It's a messed up one that only we, as viewers, arrange/organize on which should be first and which should be last. Sometimes, when I ponder it back, almost gave the vibe of Curious Play (anime adaptation from manga, but clueless-reset). I'm alright with how the ending is, just in-between, from ep1 to finish.... again, it has potential, but as everyone stated: a mess.

Some massive and others subjective. I'll list them and leave it to you to decide how you feel about watching this series. 1. The series drags a bit and could have been wrapped up sooner. I almost didn't feel like continuing several times. Nearly 70% of the episodes were watched in 1.25x or 1.5x speed for this reason.2. Casting issues that feel confusing. The FL is depicted as knowing the ML as a child while he was already an adult. But later they seem to be of the same age. Similarly, an adult female character is introduced to two children and later they look like they are older than her or the same age while she hasn't aged at all.3. The FL is initially shown as a powerful force and a strong woman but her character deteriorates significantly. She becomes unbearable, overbearing, a bully, extremely suspicious without justification at times, breaks and enters while portraying a cop, beats up the ML, her fight scenes are a joke, she ruins investigations and leads by the ML, and is the worst character in the series.4. No chemistry between the ML and FL. I don't understand why they even like each other.5. The humour is funny but at times cringeworthy. For example baby talk, split pants, pulling faces. Not really my style.6. The action was ruined in the finale. Something that I had been looking forward to. Almost fell asleep at one point.The good aspects that got me through.1. The cafe Minamdang team has good chemistry and they are the heart of this show.2. The male lead acting as a shaman could have easily come across as over the top but he kept it classy. He lives up to his character as a profiler and is good at catching clues.3. The mystery element is decent.4. When the humour is good, it's entertaining. I am glad that this was a light show considering the number of murders taking place.5. If you enjoy strong female leads then that would be the character of the sister. Enjoyable persona. Cafe Minamdang is not the best mystery, detective, comedy, action series so I wouldn't honesty recommend it for any of these genres. There are better shows out there. But if you like the male lead then you'll enjoy it."

Why is that? -this drama started sooo promising, good story with some kind of a fresh twist I like - a male lead character who is handsome, rather rich but still very unhappy and lonely in his life. As a counterpart, a female lead character who is stubborn, painfully straight forward, but rather strong  willed.This is a mix I have rarely seenin K-dramas yet, and I feel it's refreshing and realistic to show that men, also handsome, rather successful men, can be unhappy and lonely and hurt. The story was progressing rather slowly from the beginning and I did like that pace as the main characters neeed the time to find ways to reach each other, it only makes sense in all the story context. I found the pace and development perfect until episode 7. From episode 8 on and  I was a little worried that due to the fact this has 16 episodes, it suddenly started to drag.The lead characters both around at least 30 or even 40, first needed some very understandable time to become aware of their feelings for each other, given they are both shy people when it comes to personal emotions, and given the difficult circumstances.But from episodes 8 on we got more and more if these dragging scenes, the characters just standing around in slo-mo forever looking sad, or walking along a street in slo-mo. looking sad etc. It felt like time fillers to me from a certain pointWe had the lead characters confessing their feelings for / to each other from episodes 8 to 10, they  go camping together sleeping in the same small tent and spending the night there (the writers just completely leaving out what happened there? What did they talk about? how did they say good night? how did they interact? how was the next morning waking up togther etc. etc?)We even have them spending a real night together as lovers, the fl openly confessing her love to the ml  and then? Nothing, the next day these two people, who are not teenagers but between 30 and 40 years old and very good looking both of them, act like 13- year old teeagers, awkward, cold, distanced, even like they don't know each other personally? I didn't find that convincing. (In reality: These two lead characters have been drawn to each other for what feels like forever. They finally spend the night together. Yeah, you know what would happen after that? If you ever had that situation yourself with such a prolonged...'forepaly', you know exactly that hormones are in crazy mode after spending such first night finally,  and there is no way these two people would act like strangers and all cold the next day. Normally, after all that and confessing to each other, you search the next possible time window to spend more time together and you definitely interact differently, even when it's small things, and you look at each  other differently.) After epsiode 12 the dragging gets worse. There are so many silent scenes in slow motion repeating themselves, where you see either the ml or the fl walking down any street suuuperslowly (especially the fl), looking dazed and sad, or the ml sitting somewhere (either his appartment, a  noodle shop or his office) looking blank and sad.It was just too much of that slow motion walking and looking sad for me. You can use that to accentuate important moments, or moments of real daze and sadness, but when it is used like here the effect wears off and it feels artficial and annoying.So, the story unfolds, the ml finally hears that the fl is the daughter of his dead stepdad and one of the siblings who got thrown out of their house because of his bitchy, nasty mother. He tries everything to clear the situation, even gets them the house back.His mother, remaining  the nastiest person, gets forgiveness from everyone (which I find HIGHLY unbelievable, especially because she  did not change one bit and was just a bit softer for a short moment because she felt pity for herself for having been caught.) What happens to her in the end? We don't really get to know. I found the last two episodes even worse to be honest. Apart from lots more dragging slow-mo scenes, we suddenly see the pharmacy guy getting together with the fl's older sister - which felt forced to me. I didn't feel like that could have really happened like it did, simply because the pharmacy guy had strong feelings for the fl for years. Suddenly switching to her sister felt strange to me.So, back to the leads; after all is cleared, surprisingly everyone forgave the ml's awful mother, the siblings get back the house etc - and  our leads?  -  still do a supertragic ' we have to seperate, goodbye forever' - ending of their relationship at a point when it's not necessary anymore? Oo (All of it by the way with both of them having almost robotic blank and sad facial expressions all the time, even when they are alone with each other in the woods.) Ok, even if so, and although I don't get why at that point, they don't do it the way most probably would, by  particularly _not_ meeting again to not make it even more hurtful,  but istead send a message or talk on the phone to say goodbye,  -  our leads?  They go the extra painful length of driving out of Seoul two hours to go to the favourite wooden trail of the ml, walking together in the sunshine at the most romantic place to then really, expresionlessly, saying goodbye in front of the fl's house? No way!Then, a time jump all of a sudden, one year later.  So for some unknown reason the leads really haven't seen each other for a full year. Then, for further unknown reasons, the older sister suddenly tells the flthat their mother kind of forgave the ml already  a year ago (which makes me wonder why the mother wouldn't have told the fl herself a long time ago knowing perfectly well how much her daughter is in love with the guy), the brother sets up a meeting of the leads at a rooftop concert, they both get there, the ml has a bunch of flowers, (endless slow motion again Oo) - they smile at each other and?.....THE END? I was just annoyed at the end, thinking like what? Why? Why didn't the mother tell her way before she forgave the ml? Why didn't they get together after it was all cleared up a year earlier and instead do this reall weird break up scene with  the wooden trail? Why all of a sudden can they now meet exactly a year later, why the flowers, why now?  What  then? And I just couldn't get past this unchanged behaviour of the leads after they had spent that night together, I felt like I  just saw they were actors acting, and that these two people have not spent a night together. You know, when you are in love like that, when there is such longing, and after you have finally spent a night together, knowing the other person intimately, their body, their scent, etc, you just look at each other differently, you act differently etc. It was just obvious it was an artificial script with two actors who played their roles like it was written down, but these two characters didn't really exist and they were not in love or had spend a night a after a long time of longing for each other. All in all, almost the whole second half of the episodes was rather disappointing and it got worse with every episode. If the writers  would have kept the good tension and realistic vibe they had from episode 1-7, It could have been one of the best and most touching stories in a long time then."

This is a 2021 (well filmed mostly 2917 but not aired until 2021) South Korean Romantic drama with 16, 70 minute episodes.  Also known under the title Mojito.First I write a synopsis then reviewSynopsisA tragic event led Chin Ji Woo (Sung Joon) to literally run from his past.  But the money he had as a chaebol heir is running dry and he returns home anticipating a piece of inheritance from his recently deceased grandfather.  In the course of being a rich play boy, he encounters So Joong Hee (also known as Soju; Im Ji Yeon) whom he discovers will do many things for the right amount of money. He is fascinated by this person that lives so differently than he does and decides to play with her.  While Ji Woo did not inherit a lot of money he did get an old building filled with books.  Since his family has cut him off (partially to keep him from leaving) Ji Woo comes up with the ipunique idea of having a day drinking bar which he calls Siesta.  Joong Hee becomes his part timer to pay off a debt she wounded up having to him.

What is the tragedy from Ji Woos life that had him running from emotional pain?  Will Siesta flourish or fail?ReviewI think a huge determining factor in whether you like this drama or not is if you are okay with characters who have deep flaws or if you watch dramas to escape the ugly side of reality.  The central romance itself is believable and cute but so nany of the characters around them have serious emotional problems.  It is good, you can definitely tell it was filmed in 2017 as it has this darker style and just has the cultural essence of that time period.  It is good and I would recommend it for those that like romances.  I will not likely rewatch it so it is not a top favorite but still worth a watch.  SpoilersJi Woo is so cruel, at times to Soju that it is really hard to understand what she sees in him when there is a guy that is so sweet and caring to her in the form of her bestie.  However, there is this scene when the two seconds ask each other what they see in the lead couple and their answers are telling.  They basically provide a list of bad qualities and then say but I love them anyway.   Ji Woo acts very cool and uncaring on the exterior but actually winds up taking care of all those in need who cross his path.  He is fun and interesting and it is that charisma that draws people to him.  Soju is very caring.  She cannot pass someone in need without helping.  She makes food she thinks others will like and is a hard worker.  Which, I think, is the reason Ji Woo and Soju are better suited than the two people who like them.  The fact that they see and bring out these positive qualities is what makes for a good relationship."

However, he always ends up cleaning up after the problems caused by Yoo Ryung and holds the key to solving the cases.","Ahn Seung Gyun, Jo Jae Yoon, Jung Eugene, Ki Do Hoon, Kim Seon Ho, Moon Geun Young",tvN,"Character wise: At the beginning, none of the main leads are likable. They each have their own flaws which can annoy you. I mean it definitely annoyed me to see one who was reckless while the other didn't want to do anything at all and leave it in the hands of others; however you do begin to see character development in the male lead, Ji Suk.  He eventually became my favorite character in this drama because of his selflessness and sacrifice. The female lead, Yoo Ryung, on the other hand, is the exact opposite. This is where the extra patience comes in. Her character can be a make it or break it for the viewers.  If you can't stand her character because of her actions, you'll end up dropping this drama because she doesn't have development until after her secret is revealed which is around ep 11.  So if you can tolerate the frustration she will give you, then you'll make it to the point where she's becoming a bit more likable.  The frustrating second lead Ma Ri just seems like an angry person overall. She's pretty much mad at everything. She does become better towards the last few episodes but the progression for her reaching that point doesn't make sense at all. It's like one talk and she completely flipped 180. And then we have second lead Woo Hyuk which honestly he didn't really seem like he had a big role. He has the looks but that's about it. He attempts to form a love triangle between the leads but it fails just because Yoo Ryung wasn't into the romance department.  I will say that the subway ghost does have actor potential to be the next lead character after seeing his acting on here. His acting was really convincing and I say he was able to outshine all of the other characters.Story wise: It was a good introduction. I think this drama started off strong with the plot, only to fall short midway and towards the end. I liked how these cases, or I called it side stories, ended up telling a story that the leads can relate too, though most of the cases related to Yoo Ryung.  The plot began to drag for me as it seemed like every week it was the same old thing and very little discoveries on what the title of this drama was about, ""catch the ghost"" or in this case subway ghost.  I like how you couldn't guess who the subway ghost actually is. The writers make you believe it's person or that person. You always have suspicions. That being said, I'm disappointed the way the last episode was handled. The subway ghost had a big revealing, had a back story, only to be scrapped off in the first 15 mins of the episode.  We don't know if he was caught or he died. That remains unknown which is lame because I say he played a vital role to this drama. It's just an okay ending overall, not bad or even sad but just nothing really big to talk about.SUMMARY: If you can withstand, have the patience, tolerate, the frustrations of the female lead, and secondary female lead, then you'll be able to watch this drama from start to finish. Is it worth it? Well, the progression of the plot is slow, the last episode is missing a lot of important details so it did felt rush, romance is there but maybe towards the last few episodes.  You'll probably not missing much if you past on this but if you like the actor or actress, hey give it a shot."

Engaging Drama : From opening scene to the closing credits, Drama successfully captivated viewers attention, maintaining a high level of engagement throughout.What I Didn't Like :1. Story Development : While the direction & execution were great, the story was not really upto the mark. However, the overall quality of the production compensated for this drawback.2. Characterization : The female lead's character & some supporting characters in the story could be better developed. There is a problem with the female lead's portrayal because her past wealthy background contradicts her surprised reaction to scandals involving rich people. This inconsistency makes her initial character description seem unrealistic because she appears overly naive in her responses.3. Romance line : Makers tried to show romance between 2 main leads but it was not really convincing. Both leads have chemistry but romance line was weak but its ok as main genre of drama was not romance.4. Lack of Relatability : Throughout the drama, I found it difficult to connect with the story & its characters, which detracted from my overall viewing experience.Overall, the show is a worthwhile one time watch, especially for those who have a keen interest in fashion related dramas."

The writers created a whole mood. They set up their tale very well, sometimes I wondered if we were watching a tale woven by the main character, novelist Kang Yeo Joo, rather than a narrative about her...and I'll let you wonder as well. This is the kind of thriller I like most - it had mystery, drama, romance, and a touch of comedy as well. There was nothing lacking in this drama of suspense. The writers kept you guessing until almost the end when they finally unpacked all the secrets. It had some flaws, which affected my rating, but overall I was pretty pleased with the show. Cho Yeo Jung was perfect as Kang Yeo Joo. I wasn't as big a fan of Go Joon in this as in other things I've seen him, but he didn't do a *bad* job, there were just certain traits this character had that I wasn't fond of. I enjoyed all the supporting characters also, and the major ones did a wonderful job. I thought the music was pretty great, actually, though! My favorite track was the theme song, O.V.E.R. by SURAN. It was really catchy and I definitely added it to my drama playlist. :)Normally, I wouldn't re-watch a show like this as the suspense and mystery is gone after the first watch, but I honestly wouldn't mind seeing this one again.

The drama opted to drag things up and stretch the big conclusion as to give a more interesting perspective, however, that resulted in destroying the whole story.

(Source: AsianWiki; edited by MyDramaList)","Bae In Hyuk, Han Ji Hyun, Jang Gyu Ri, Kim Hyun Jin, Lee Eun Saem, Lee Min Jae",SBS,"Mediocre male characters that still somehow made the fans fight.   For a drama that on the surface, on paper seems to present many interesting issues, fun plotlines, entertaining characters - this was a massive fail. With all that was technically going on in the drama, the fact that which male character should the female lead end up with was the hottest topic among the viewers shows how unengaging everything was. Heres the thing, I actually enjoyed it at first. Do Hae Yi was refreshingly bubbly and shameless about her love for money. Her enthusiasm and energy seemed realistic and fun. Loved her interactions with all the characters and was curious about a potential character development and possible change of priorities in her life (or at least some adjustments). For the most part her character was painfully stagnant, just to start hiding things and being less straightforward in the later episodes. They tried to fix that in last few episodes, but it was too little too late. Characters wise, it felt like a huge waste of initial set up. More or less none of the characters got any development. They started and finished on the same note. We got some small changes of personalities in some side characters, but the mains were completely forgotten. The writers suddenly remembered they should do something about the main cast in the last two episodes, so everything felt rushed. I knew we would get a typical love triangle, but with the addition of the mystery, I thought this would actually be an interesting watch. How wrong I was. The love triangle was painful to watch, since none of the male leads was that good or interesting. One, while interesting as a character and having quite a well built story around him, had an unhealthy obsession over Hae Yi. The other had the personality of a white wall and no depth, which made him simply uninteresting. Can believe we all had arguments about these basic boys in the comment section. It did have a great set of supporting characters though. I honestly dont want to even talk about the mystery aspect. It went from tense unknown, to barely existing, to murder thriller levels of ridiculousness. The culprit was a clown and their reveal made most of the audience question the writers choices. I never felt less interested in the bad guy reveal and the fact we had to wait so long to get any answers about the motive added to the issue. An aspect I actually truly loved about the show were female friendships and support. There were no unnecessary catfights, no random jealousy - far more support, understanding and encouraging each other. Especially from Hae Yi and Sun Ja, and Choon Yang and Jin Hee. Honestly, I would not mind if they put more focus and gave more screen time for the mothers. On a completely subjective note, one of my side ships failed and it made me sad. The potential behind that couple was amazing, and it was dropped for the more obvious and less complex one. I did enjoy Han Ji Hyuns performance. She was the only memorable part of the show. Making such an exciting, hype and enthusiastic character still feel realistic and not cartoonish couldnt be an easy job, but she was able to achieve a believable result. Yes, the character was annoying in the second half, but thats on the writing not the acting.Another performance that caught my attention was Baek Ji Won as Hwang Jin Hee - Sun Hos mom. Her comedic addition had an underlying sadness and desperation to it, and I loved that this complexity was shown even in the limited screen time. As for Bae In Hyuk - oh boy. I feel bad for him. He is not a bad actor, but anyone who watched Cheer Up would probably assume he is. I honestly believe the issue was the writing of Jungwoo and not the acting itself. Portraying a character that is so poorly written is just extremely hard. Production value was high, but whats the point when the story was not?Overall, the show did not really deliver the cheers, nor the romance, nor the mystery. The friendship between Do Hae Yi and Joo Sun Ja was amazing and one of the limited saving graces of the show. The show just left me frustrated. It had great potential to be a fun, light teen drama about coming of age, building friendship, learning how to give and receive help. How to believe in yourself, but also believe in people around you. And yet they wasted a good 80% of the time on useless, boring love triangles and mess of a bullshit mystery."

First and foremost, I think you should know that this is not a food drama. It's an office drama, with the main protagonist being a big foodie and alcohol lover. Drinking is a massive part of Korean culture, especially office culture. So it's no wonder that in some episodes, the alcohol tends to take the stage during meal scenes (while in others, the food does). The alcohol is purely to go with and accentuate the meal though, as we rarely see her ordering more. And I think she only got tipsy/drunk a couple of times. What makes out FL stand out though, is that she often prefers to enjoy her meals (and thus, her alcohol) alone. But this is pretty in-character for her. She doesn't understand what everyone's fixation is with social events and gossip. In fact, she probably knows the most about everyone, simply from observing, but never gets involved unless asked to or necessary. It's very refreshing.Because of this, inter-character drama is a minimum. And there is no romance. Instead, this is a story about career success and how there is more to life than career success - through the revelations and experiences of our 30-year-old successful career woman main protagonist. I will say though that sometimes the office scenarios kicked me out of the story. Some events seem to act as if the editors are the writers of the stories they are publishing. Or will otherwise conflate the different positions within the publishing industry. Nonetheless, it was a rare find to have a drama focus the editors, rather than the writers."

From then on her life takes a turn for the worse and Hong Seol is almost certain it's all Yoo Jung's doing. So why is he suddenly acting so friendly a year later?(Source: WeTV)~~ Adapted from the webtoon ""Cheese in the Trap"" (치즈인더트랩) by Soonkki (순끼).","Kim Go Eun, Lee Sung Kyung, Nam Joo Hyuk, Park Hae Jin, Park Min Ji, Seo Kang Joon",tvN,"I'm developing a talent for being drawn to controversial dramas. Cheese in the Trap was a highly anticipated series that, while, being produced, gave rise to a cacophony of behind-the-scenes drama that escalated to such an extent that many now consider CITT one of the biggest disappointments of 2016. In light of that mess, my recommendation for enjoying this drama is to be as unfamiliar with the source material (the web-toon on which it's based) as possible. 

Now that we've got that out of the way: Despite unevenness, Cheese in the Trap is a narrative success in my books, for many of the same reasons I've also defended that other 2016 YA drama with a bad reputation, Scarlet Heart: Ryeo. (Speaking of, MLSHR is one of the recs under CITT because it, too, has a ""questionably crazy male lead."" Hilarity.)

Anyway, k-drama romances tend to fall under two trends:

(1) Zany Disney-esque romcoms where love lifts everyone up where they belong (see: My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, To the Beautiful You, You Who Came From the Stars, etc. etc. etc. etc.).
(2) Toxic and imbalanced relationships that are glorified with undeserved happily-ever-afters (see: Boys Over Flowers, The Heirs, and so on and so forth). 

Cheese in the Trap isn't either of those stories. Much like MLSHR, CITT is concerned with one overarching question: Can a person change another person? (Alternatively: Do people change *for* other people?) The show doesn't give a pat answer, and that's to its credit. 

In short, this is a slice-of-life that isn't afraid to go dark (and not in an incongruous after-school special way  unlike Age of Youth, the darkness in CITT is fully fleshed out). If you're looking for light, escapist fun that delivers a straightforward message, there are literally hundreds of other dramas for you. If, otoh, you want a complex story about young adults that doesn't idealise its characters  but also, importantly, doesn't descend into nihilism  you might want to give Cheese in the Trap a shot."

Cheo Yong Season 2,,,2586,2015.0,2015.0,10,,,,Detective Cheo Yong uses his abilities to interact with spirits to solve cases. ,"Ha Yun Joo, Jeon Hyo Sung, Joo Jin Mo, Oh Ji Ho, Yeon Je Wook, Yoo Seung Mok",OCN,"I loved season one of Cheo Yong. The story was interesting and thrilling, the characters very likable. So, I was excited when I heard about a second season. But in the end I was rather disappointed.

Every case started with a ghostly incident and I admit that those were kind of creepy. Especially when you watch them at night, alone. Unfortunately each one of them couldn't hold the tension. Of course, they had their interesting parts. But I got bored many times during one episode and just wished for them to be solved already. The suspense falls by the wayside. Sadly, that pattern doesn't get better until most of the drama is already over. Only one third of it got me hooked, honestly.

It's a shame that the ghosts become something like bystanders who almost disappear after their introduction at the beginning of every episode. They should have gotten bigger parts, it's a drama about a ghost-seeing detective after all. That one student ghost who accompanies the police is just not enough. Though I like the actress and the character she's playing... She couldn't save the day either.

The main story is evolving almost too late, considering that the drama has only 10 episodes. The saddest thing though is that is has almost nothing to do with ghosts. Solely speaking of the basic concept of that certain case, it WAS interesting. But it still missed the point and had so many flaws in its execution. Again, it should involve ghosts... There was so much potential and so many wasted opportunities in the last episode where they could have integrated those things.

I had also a hard time with scene editing, story telling, sudden conclusions that appeared out of nowhere, confusing plot twists and the way they portrayed Korean police. Like there's only this one police squad of five people that doesn't call for back-up while storming a secret gathering? Or experienced officers who mess up a crime scene? Yeah, whatever... I know that it's somewhat like a drama clich. But there are dramas where it doesn't look so bad.

Acting was solid most times. Not too bad, nothing special either. But I had a hard time with that new female member they introduced in this season. She had her good parts, too, but still couldn't win me over in the end.

I don't regret watching this since there were also some very funny parts, but all those flaws mentioned earlier didn't allow me to rate it any higher."

Chicago Typewriter,8.7,"Comedy, Political, Romance, Supernatural",#47,2017.0,2017.0,16,70.0,,"Bromance, Flashback To Past, Hardworking Female Lead, Hardworking Male Lead, Reincarnation, Strong Female Lead, Strong Friendship, Successful Male Lead, Tragic Past, Writer",This drama follows the lives of two men and a woman through two eras: one during the 1930s Japanese occupation of Korea and the other in the 21st century. The three main characters are,"Go Kyung Pyo, Im Soo Jung, Jo  Woo Jin, Kwak Shi Yang, Oh Na Ra, Yoo Ah In",tvN,"Touching. Exciting. Stylish. Passionate. Atmospherically dense, especially regarding the 1930s  For me, ""Chicago Typewriter"" needed a second attempt. The first time I didn't really know what to do with it. ...A smart spring chicken, but somehow paranoid writer, spoiled by success and money, and a cute girl as his fan? The story - fancy as it may come along - at first glance appeared a bit all too playfully shallow for my taste. I wasn't convinced. Although I actually really like actor Yoo Ah-in.Actually, I was mainly curious about the past (around 1930 when Korea was a colony of Japan). One of ""Chicago Typewriter""'s two storylines is set in the context of the 1930's Gwangju student movement. With regard to the KDramas historical plot line though, it felt like nothing really happened for a long time. Accordingly, when I first had tried to watch ""Chicago Typewriter"", I didn't make it past the ""beginning"". However, somehow I kept stumbling across this KDrama and it wouldn't let go off me. Eventually I gave it another try. Lo and behold, with a little patience, the KDrama took me by the hand and developed an exciting story with a lot of passion and atmospheric density, especially when it came to the 1930s. The insight into that time had lasting impressions. Still, the relationship dynamics between the leads especially in the present time story line sometimes were little too light-weight, harmless and on the verge of silliness for my taste. However this was perfectly balanced in the context of their mission in the past and got more profound as the story proceeded.-------------------------  SIDE NOTE: --- Japanese colonialism ---During the 1930s Japanese imperialism had reached its peak. In relation to Korea, a rigorous policy of assimilation, using force if necessary, was pursued, e.g. the Korean language, culture and history were systematically suppressed as part of a Japanese colonial education. The first Gwangju student movement, which culminated in a nationwide anti-Japan demonstration, happend in November 1929 after a female Korean student having been molested by Japanese students. This attack was certainly not the first, but the Korean student movement had formed in such a way that a large-scale street demonstration in Gwangju spontaneously took place after this incident. The mood swept across the whole country...-------------------------As a premise, the KDrama plays with the concepts of reincarnation and the concept of spirits remaining in near-earth realms after their death, until their unresolved past experiences are somehow redeemed. Both are popular motifs that are often picked up in KDramas. In this case, the producers have created a particularly beautiful and profound story, especially with regard to redemption. In 2017, the characters get a second chance, so to speak: they have the choice of whether they want to continue in their familiar pattern or make new decisions. Theres an opportunity to reconcile past guilt or open questions, to let go of the energy that still hangs in the past and to move on in the NOW. This aspect of time jumps is unabashedly and creatively juggled with an undeniable love for details.

A special charm: The ghost from back then becomes a ""ghostwriter"" in 2017 when he meets his reincarnated comrades-in-arms.

The faster the time jumps, the higher the tension rises. It's actually going to be really dramatic, both in the past AND present... In sum: the KDrama is giving you a clear idea of living under Japanese colonialism and of the resistance movement that rebelled against it.

I also love Kang Seon Young, she is as sly as Tae Jun but is a lot cleaner in handling things. She also doesnt back away even when against the old bad guys in politics.3. I actually love them as a couple, i'm impressed that despite being in opposite camps most of the time, they are able to fight back and protect each other. I just find it unbelievable that no one knew of their relationship for 5 years yet each one can dig the dirtiest secret from each other. Lol. They even live in together and no one realized they had the same address?4. I also like the bad guys.. i think they casted almost all of the usual baddies in dramas. I laos liked the supporting swuad, from Hyewon, who is willing to help Taejun, Manseok as Seonyoung's trusted aide, to Dogyeong the naive intern.5. I was shocked twice and both were tragic. End of ep 8 when Taejun's mentor killed himself. And last episode when another person died. Totally didnt expect these plot twists. It's like saying you really wont survive politics if you are too clean. You need to be as smart and manipulative as everyone to survive.

One thing I love about both seasons of Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff 2 respectively is the realism in their story, alongside greatly built characters and character development. Even though it was ten episodes, some episodes, like in the first season, did feel quite slow, and that's the reason why the re-watch value may be a little low here, but I still recommend people to check this series out, especially if you enjoy dramas in the politics genre etc. Acting was again great, although the tiniest bit weaker compared to it's first season in my eyes, but nothing of a major difference so don't worry!

A bold story that comes across without make-up by Korean standards  If you're looking for a KDrama of the usual type, then you won't find it in ""Children of Nobody"". Here you are dealing with an impressive psychological thriller with lasting influence that comes across without make-up by Korean standards. This is about child abuse. The powerful here are not the economic giants, but the parents in their sacred halls. Not funny. The story wants to stir you up and it does. In the original, the title is actually ""Red Moon, Blue Sun"" and alludes to modern South Korean poetry that has been quoted several times. In connection with the crimes against children, poetry seems downright paradoxical.If ""Children of Nobody"" at the time didn't make spectacular waves in the ratings, it's not because it wasn't done convincingly, but because there are a large number of unreported families in South Korea for whom physical abuse and the ""stick of love"" are still taken for granted. Sooner or later, these viewers would have to take a good look at their own noses. The topic is treated in a differentiated manner from a wide variety of perspectives.----------------------------------------- SIDE NOTE: --- child abuse vs free, upright citizens ---If people are broken mentally and physically from an early age, how are they supposed to learn to live as upright citizens? The road to free, responsible citizens still seems a long way off. 20/30 years ago in South Korea - without high technology, ubiquitous internet and social media - many people in their personal world largely only knew people for whom these practices of physical abuse were also a matter of course. The children and young people of today and the young parents of tomorrow, on the other hand, grew up in a time when they could learn a lot more about alternative living environments, value systems and educational concepts through the media. The field of consciousness is expanding. Conflicts with traditional structures arise. New perspectives are given space. In the exchange via social media, resistance and support can form, discussions are held and new values and self-images spread. Change becomes possible.---------------------------------------------------------------KDramas increasingly provide positive models of how things must become different in the future. In its own way, it tries to straighten things out in the context of child abuse that many take for granted.Therfore ""Children of Nobody"" is a strong production. A bold story. A commitment to a future with free, responsible citizens - precisely because they are ruthlessly confronting with where society (in South Korea) actually stands. Fantastic actors. Captivating story. Highly valuable."

They do lots of cool things. They can vacuum. They help build cars and other stuff. Some robots are even helping with medical procedures. This is all good stuff. Theres lots of robots on screen too from the droids in the Star Wars universe (mostly entertaining) to the invaders from outer space in Michael Bays Transformers franchise (less positive things to say about them) and the robots that look human like The Terminator or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation). [reviewers note: apologies for the list of references to Western fare]Robots can be a contributing element for an entertainment production. When they are, its because they are usually imbued with human-like personalities. Sadly, the reverse works less effectively. Human characters meant to be more robotic in their personality rarely seem to engage viewers. This may seem like an odd introduction to a drama set in modern day South Korea with no sci-fi or fantasy or supernatural element but rather named after and with running references to Greek mythology. Before this all connects, a digression:Chimera is a drama focused on a serial killer that uses incendiary traps to kill. A spree thirty-five years prior to the current timeline ended when a suspect was apprehended and committed suicide in police custody. A new string of deaths is now following the same patterns. Thats the show.To its credit, this setup is surprisingly good. There is more than a bit of chemistry and science and it is presented in a way that the average onlooker can make sense of. Its a different approach to creating a serial killer character. It also helps to physically separate the killer from the crimes so the entire scene can be captured without revealing the identity of the chimera killer too early. As characters become suspicious and then are discovered to be not bad guys or at least not The Bad Guy, the narrative nicely keeps springing action scenes and surprises at a regular clip. Had an equally accomplished cast of characters been participating in such a narrative, it would have been a terrific show.There is one. Kim Su Hyuns Eugene Hathaway, an FBI profiler thats been shipped overseas, would have been the ideal character to lead Chimera and build the show around. Shes intellectual but also empathic. She excels in a high pressure environment. And Kim Su Hyun shows why shes appeared in two of the biggest cinematic franchises on the planet (the MCU and Harry Potter). But the show is instead built around Park Hae Soos Jae Hwan, a detective that is a maddeningly inconsistent character. At times, he is utterly befuddled at the worst possible time and finds the absolute worst thing to do. Other times, he is Mr. Cop Cliche: bristling with superiors when told what to do, playing the bad cop type in an interrogation and convinced that his half-baked hunch is all he needs to take down his target. Park Hae Soo does what he can, but with all the focus on him, its an impossible character to salvage.The rest of the crew is where the robots come in:The doctor - calculatingThe special investigative team leader - grimThe lawyer - quietThe police vet - subduedThe mother - withdrawnThe CEO - restrainedThe CEOs wife - buttoned upThe CEOs wifes brother - resoluteThe closed circuit tv police officer - shyThe other police officers - so much the typical police character that they could be facelessThats the theme. One robotic character after another appears on screen and when they show up, they tend to be there for extended appearances. Granted, not every fictional character needs to be some wild carnival barking exuberant rainbow of personality, but the calculus should not be to take three monotones, put them on couches and let them mumble to each other for a good chunk of an episode. The collective ends up being a group thats difficult to connect with so when cast members start getting picked off, its a shrug and an oh well and lets move on.It helps less that Woo Hyun appears with regularity in Chimera. Somehow this gentleman who, in person, might be the kindest and most charitable man in the hemisphere regularly gets work despite the fact that he is one of the top five most graceless actors in the industry and the only one of the five that didnt get the work because his day job is as a successful idol.Layer in some lame explosion special effects, conventional camera work, no interesting OST to speak of and a regular pattern of alternating stronger episodes with slower episodes and the production as a whole simply never gains more than a modicum of traction. In a better vehicle, Park Hae Soo and Kim Su Hyun could be a phenomenal pair of actors. Chimera is not that show. Not recommended."

There was Ha Ji Won, who is undeniably my favorite actress and who succeeded in portraying a compassionate, graceful woman to the T. There was food and whole lotta good shots of it which is basically catnip for every foodie out there and me being one, I did a happy dance inside every time I saw someone eating or cooking- which was A LOT. There was some bromance, sismance, amazing chemistry between the leads and family bonding sprinkled all over it and last but not the least; the message it went out to portray was brilliant.Despite the inevitablity of death, people can still find moments of happiness. It was beautiful and heart-warming to watch.In the beginning, that is. Despite being a slow burn in every sense of the word, the show did go pretty fast for me up to about 7 episodes. I was really really into it but then the monotony started setting in. It's the same K-drama tropes over and over again and soon enough you realize that there isn't much of a unique spin on it.Call me heartless but when you show me the same sentimental shit and corny deep dialogues in literally every episode, I'll go from being touched to annoyed real fast. That's because over-doing emotion takes the sincerity out of it. Every case was more or less the same and that irked me a lot.A lot of things were added as useless plot devices and left unexplored. It was almost criminal how little screentime the main couple got. You barely get to see them together till around 12th episodes and even then it's scarce and underwhelming.I feel like the show dabbled in a lot of things but didn't truly go into depth for even one. And it's a shame truly, given the immense potential.Towards the end, I just had to fast forward stuff- an urge I was physically restraining for about 14 episodes.A reviewer said that it's a great drama for new watchers and I agree but if you have already seen these tropes a billion times and in their most basic form, this drama will end up being quite mediocre for you.I'd rather watch 'Just Between Lovers' that took one of the issues also mentioned in this drama, went in depth with it and actually managed to portray sadness, heartbreak and loss in a way that was never over the top and yet, extremely impactful."

Yes, hate is a strong word, but it's also accurate. I had to force myself to finish this, and the last 2 episodes were barely watchable. I can hardly remember the first few episodes, when this drama slowly started to grow on me, and gave me some Boys over Flowers type feels... Now all I have left is the wish that I had given up on this drama much sooner. Where do I even begin?

The plot makes no sense. A rich guy finds his 3 dead son's sons and forces them to live in a fancy home together, even though they don't get along. His solution is to hire a weird poor girl to move in and trick them into getting along, just as long as she doesn't date them? What???!!! Obviously the premise is just a set up to put her in close proximity with 3 cute guys (4 if you count the hot secretary), and honestly I was willing to forgive the implausibility of it all just to watch that often repeated k-drama dynamic of ""which cute guy do I choose?""- but unfortunately the show dared to introduce another female lead which literally killed any joy I found watching the show. Once they tried to force feed that story into the plot, the show lost it's charm, and that brought my attention to how dumb the rest of the plot really was. Oh, and the flashbacks... waaaaaaay too many flashbacks filling up the time. Each flashback seemed to say ""remember that part that you liked"" as a way to distract from how bad the current story was. 

As for the cast, it took me a while to warm up to Park So Dam as Ha Won. She bored me at first, the same way she initially bored me in Beautiful Mind, but eventually I started to root for her. She's quirky, and kinda naive, yet outspoken, and honest. She was definitely giving me Jan Di from BoF flashbacks. She is matched with the 3 leads, and had cute chemistry with each of them. Playboy Hyun Min had great second lead potential in the beginning. I liked many of their early scenes together. Seo Woo is super sweet, and a cute match to watch throughout the show, although they spend less time together as the show progresses. Then of course there's Jung Il Woo as Ji Woon... the reason I kept watching. He has great charisma, and his smirk won me over early on. There were moments where he and Park So Dam looked like they really could be dating, that's how cute they were together. That's also what tricked me into sticking with this show... every time I was about to quit watching they would have a moment that sucked me back in. I should also mention the cute secretary (I guess he's prince #4) who's character, and storyline, seemed like an afterthought, but I really liked him a lot (I personally would have chosen him). 

So if most of the main cast was pretty good, why such a low score? The answer is Son Na Eun as Hye Ji. She is not just bad, she is a ruiner of scenes. Not only is her character terribly written... they try to make you empathize with a crazy ex who can't let go, and it did not work for me... She is also just not a great actress at all. Her expressions were bland, her emotions felt fake (tears of the crocodile variety), and I'm not an A Pink fangirl so I don't get her appeal. I felt like groaning every time she was on screen, which was more and more as the show progressed. She ruined any love I had for the show, and by the end her scenes became moments to take bathroom breaks, or check messages or my email... I wish the show was half as long and omitted her entire storyline (which also made no sense, but I won't spoil it). A good rival should add to the plot, not make you want to never watch again. Grandpa CEO was also a terrible character, and frustrating to watch, but his acting wasn't terrible so it worked. Other parents were equally annoying, but still not as bad as Na Eun (and had much less screen time). The only character who annoyed me as much is Ja Yeong, the BFF of Ha Won. I guess I was supposed to find her creepy fangirl personality cute, but she annoyed me. The forced romance implications were also not working for me. Ahh, forced romance... that brings me to the end... ugh!

I honestly wanted to see how it would all be resolved, but the ending felt so forced, and overly romantic, that I would have rather had a tragic sappy ending where everyone died. The ending scene was so incredibly cheesy that I couldn't take it. The only thing I liked was the surprise (totally predictable) backstory between Ji Woon and Ha Won, that I wish was the main focus of the show in the first place. Of course they add unnecessary drama to the final moments too, but there are no surprises, so I don't recommend forcing yourself to stick it out to the end.

The soundtrack is not my favorite, but it's the best part of the show after the main kissing scenes.

Would I watch this again? Never. I'm still wondering why I didn't stop watching weeks ago!

Overall this show is bad... really bad, in spite the cute moments that I wish could be pieced together to form it's own mini show. If you start it, you will probably be tempted to keep watching, but let me assure you that once it starts going down hill it will only get worse. Just watch youtube clips of the best scenes from the show, and don't bother trying to make sense of the messy storyline, or care who the characters are... clearly the writer didn't care either. I can't believe this is based on a book, and I wonder how much this show misses the mark. 

I wish I could go back in time and drop this drama. If you're wondering if it's better to watch and drop, or to never watch at all, I would say both choices are better than forcing yourself to watch the whole thing. I give the show a 4 - one point for each of the 4 prince cuties interactioning with the lead. That's basically all the show has to offer, and that's not enough to fill 16 episodes. With soooo many cinderella themed k-dramas out there, this literal one is the one you should miss."

I am honestly not sure.The set up and idea behind the story is one of the most interesting things I have seen not only in BLs, but any romance. The concept of monos and probes opens the door for so many different dynamics in the relationships and paths that could be taken. Monos hating the probes for messing up their current life. Probes hating and fearing monos because of their possible obsessions. Monos being overprotective of their probes, since they are their way to see colors. This and so much more, to never be explored, because its just a short mini series and not a full length kdramaThe show focuses on the forming connection and relationship between Yeon Woo and Yoo Han, and the internal dilemma Yeon Woo has, when faced with his probe. Taking into consideration the length of the show, the romance between boys is well presented. The chemistry is amazingly natural and believable. The intensity of the emotions and decisions made because of them, closer to the end, does feel a bit rushed, but it can be forgiven (trigger warning in the comment hidden under spoiler).There were some side plots that were either forgotten or not addressed, with the missing mom being the cherry on top. I need to know more about it. I need to actually know the full back story, how they looked for her so far. Also, Kim Min Jae? More. I need more old man and the explanation behind it. His character alone was interesting enough to have a proper story written around him.The best part of the show was Yeon Woo. Poor boy could not take a break between his mom missing, the aunt being overprotective and at times too controlling, and him forming a bond with Yoo Han that scared the hell out of him. Not to mention, I actually enjoyed Yoo Juns acting quite a lot. Which is not surprising - he has been acting for years.Talking about acting, Im on the fence with Heo Hyun Juns performance. While his playful and cheeky side was perfect, any more emotional scenes and lines felt flat and robotic.With a limited budget, the production value was truly good. It was aesthetically pleasing, most scenes were not cut in weird places and the flow was decent. The aspect I truly loved was the soundtrack. I need each and every song right now.Overall, its hard for me to be objective, because the unused potential of the plot just hurts me. This could have been so much more than just a romance. With proper world building, explaining how society works around the idea of monos and probes. So much to explore, so little time.Still, for a short love story, it was fun. Me having wild imagination and seeing the potential - I need more.+ Can we talk about Yoo Han's make up tho? Damn, boi was whiter than the snow outside of my window."

I feel bad that I'm giving it such a low rating. But this just didn't measure up and I have to be honest.I'll try my best to explain why.The first Color Rush was a combination of light horror and romance. It didn't solve the mystery it introduced, which felt disappointing, but it was great nonetheless.It knew not to give up absolutely everything about this world with Monos and Probes. And its effects, music, narration, tone, and slow build made it believably ""otherworldly."" Plus, there was good chemistry between the MLs and a fascinating and twisted balance of power between them. There was mutual feelings and mutual obsession and tension at the mere possibility of them being around each other.When people saw it they not only wanted the mystery solved/explored they wanted to see more of the unique world they created, right?This second season fulfilled that wish. Incorrectly. It dumped too much of the world on the viewers and despite being about the same length as the original (about five minutes shorter each episode) constantly rushed through everything. There was no time to process, it was, ""Let's get to the next scene."" And, the action was weak, there wasn't any believable tension or weight to the story or characters' actions, sets and effects looked too cheap, and the writing wasn't up to par. Not to mention the ML didn't act like his character would have in his situation. I would expect him to have done something rash and/or be wallowing in misery. Rather than that, he seemed just a bit upset and to be going about life fine. Where was the despair? The agony?And of course, writing out the other ML was the biggest reason this failed.

My complaints lie in the back end of the story, and most especially with the last 2 episodes. I'm not sure if the pacing got off due to pre-emptions for the World Cup and elections, or if they made changes in the story. But the last episode was just super cheesy and didn't fit the tone of the rest of the show at all. One scene in particular - that I won't spoil -  was just corny, and I was cringing so hard about it. (Surprisingly, a scene that a few commenters found tear inducing. I felt quite the opposite about it.)While the story sort of floundered mid-way, I can't say enough about the cast - the acting was on point. Jang Ki Yong and Nam Da Reum were kings of facial expression. Heo Joon Ho was appropriately terrifying. Kim Kyung Nam elicited unexpected feelings towards his character as well. Seo Jung Yeon was perfect as the selfless mother to sons that weren't even hers. And Kim Seo Hyung, the reporter, was even more hated than the villain of the story. I had no complaints about the acting. I doubt I will ever rewatch this, and honestly if I had just known the ending for our star-crossed lovers, I would have been happy to have skipped out on the last episode altogether."

Probably not .In all honesty,  I can already think of numerous K- Dramas out there which have tackled the theme of  relationships and even issues over North Korea more in depth and realistically  than this drama as well as better pacing . ( Korean Peninsula  , Spy,  Iris and even The King 2 Hearts .)However, lets not bring this drama down entirely. Crash Landing On You  was an entertaining  rom-com and this was particularly seen through the comical gold and actual intrigue between the cultural differences of the group of our North- Korean  soldiers and our female lead  Yoon Se- Ri played by Son Ye- Jin. ( Language choices, gestures, popular culture etc. ) Additionally, praise must also be given for renowned  scriptwriter Park Ji- Eun ( Legend Of The Blue Sea, My Love From The Star) daring to tackle the trickier concept of an international and humanising taboo relationship between a North- Korean solider ( Hyun Bin) and a South- Korean chabeol heiress ( Son Ye-Jin). Although it makes for good script material, most of the shows centralisation in North Korea did bring one flaw to the show, where the premise  write what you know wasnt  always the best solution for Ji- Eun. Whilst the show did share some evident cultural differences and dangers of life in North Korea ( especially surrounding our second Male lead played by Kim Jung- Hyun), it was never exactly going to  be from the get-go a fly on the wall documentary of what life is actually like in one of the most isolated countries in the world. Yet even by Crash Landing On Yous standards , it was fairly eye brow raising to try and gloss over the oppression , lack of freedom of speech and even the fact that North- Korea is a communist dictatorship with the classic and beyond comical  element of having a department store ( a very  consumerist South-Korean element) and  Rich Ahjummas in a country where  money restrictions are so severe. Whilst I do appreciate  that the show was try to humanise our characters ( and did this successfully to some extent) by showing North- Koreans to be actually human beings rather than the  enemy and  threats, it still felt poorly tackled how the show decided to gloss over a lot of these more predominant issues over actual circumstances for many North-Koreans in order to add to the angst and humanity of our characters. This also moves on to a strange plot point over our two main characters as well as Se- Ris debates over suicide only being mentioned when it was necessary to earlier or later storyline. ( There was little explanation over this element of Se- Ris decisions which would have given her depth  apart from just Ji-Eun just wanting  to add  angst before the  big plot twist in the finale).So, what are my final words to you upon this drama? Is it worth watching, or is it a waste of time? Probably the biggest thing I should say that is Crash Landing On You isnt a terrible drama and has a lot of fun playing with the renowned tropes of rom-coms. The ending is bittersweet, the  concept is quite interesting, the characters and cast will grow on you and the cinematography and filming locations ( particularly in Switzerland and Mongolia) are gorgeous  .   On the other hand, the pacing simply falls  after the halfway point to a slump, the glossing over and the attempts to write a mini- Seoul in Pyongyang were ridiculous in addition to the portrayal of North Korea and certain characters. It can probably be concluded that   whilst good, the show is just a  little too overrated . If youre looking for a binge-watch and something to easily watch and throw aside, its a perfect watch, however, its fair to say that if youre looking for actual depth, characterisation and sensical storyline, then there are so many other  dramas  out there to consider."

The cases are interesting however the way that the story was constructed was way too bland and cliche.There were episodes that caught my emotions and I was really shocked when they took the route where 'someone dies' which I thought wouldn't however that just what it is. Even the main characters lacks depth on their characters and is more on one-dimensional. It felt like I was watching them 20x on repeat with just a slightly different scenario.It was normal that most criminals especially serial killers have a turbulent childhood which led them to become a-not-so-good citizen however the characterization of the suspects here can be misunderstood as people having turbulent childhood or those who experience mental health issues are harmful and dangerous people which is not really the case. A lot of people who has mental health problems and experienced abuse are good law abiding people.As someone who watched tons of crime, serial killing, law dramas, this drama is way below the standards. I still do commend the casts though. I love the Lee JoonGi is here also Lee SunBin. And all the other casts. I just didn't like how the whole story was written.

The surgical scenes involving cutting into and working inside a patients body in the hospital operating theater are convincing and not too frightening to watch. I am not very fond of any dark/noir story; however, I decide to watch Cross because the method actor Jin Yi Han/Kim Ji Han is on this drama. The story involves illegal organ harvesting and trafficking. It is rather an eye opener for nave people, how cruel the illegal organ business is. In the beginning episodes, Actor Go Kyung Pyo as Dr. Kang In Kyu with his cold and unfriendly stare appear to be unnatural. He seems to be hesitant in interpreting his character, but he grows into his character and his stare softens when he is dealing with dying patients. His performance is engaging when he is showing his gentle side. Both female lead characters, Dr. Go Ji In (actress Jeon So Min) and Dr. Son Yeon Hee (actress Yang Jin Sung) make Cross drama lighter with their bright smiles. Their appearance is a welcome and brighten this dark/noir drama.  As always, Heo Sung Tae does not disappoints portraying a ringleader in this illegal organ harvesting and trafficking, Kim Hyung Beom. He accomplishes his interpretation as the evil character that I dislike passionately.I am unhappy to see character Dr. Go Jung Hoon (Portrayed by Actor Jo Jae Hyun) is eliminated in the middle of the drama series. He is a fine actor. Dr. Go works as a catalyst in the story; he is an authentic, benevolent, and empathic doctor that sticks to his principles and moral values. However, when Dr. Go Jung Hoon is killed, character Dr. Lee Joo Hyuk (portrayed by actor Jin Yi Han/Kim Yi Han) appears more in the subsequent episodes, and he seems to be taking over the catalyst personality and moves the story forward. Dr. Lees coconut bob haircut seems to indicate that he is a rebellious and righteous son that always disagrees with his weak doctor father regarding medical ethical matters. It is a delight to watch actor Jin Yi Han in Cross.

The share of Makjang in South Korea's series productions seems to decrease noticeably. After 3 seasons of ""The Penthouse"" in 2021, taking the evil within the ""War of Life  to the extreme, it might have been somewhat exhausted? Thus, ""Curtain Call"" may be a noticeably 'softened' Makjang series (if at all). In this manner however, the KDrama  represents a social zeitgeist that should not be underestimated: the desire for reconciliation. Reconciliation with the North. Reconciliation between generations, between the past and today. Reconciliation between duty and dream. The search, the longing, the need for South Korean society to balance itself on a new level - finding peace. To me, that's what ""Curtain Call"" stands for.As so often, the focus is on the rich and beautiful. In this family clan, too, the third generation could disassemble itself in the fight for the golden spoon. But somehow things are a bit different here than otherwise in KDrama Orbit.The head of the family is (quite progressively) a woman. Matriarchy instead of patriarchy, that makes a difference. While she probably represents business acumen and a strong leadership style, for all the respect she receives, she has NOT sacrificed her heart for her grandchildren and employees on the track. Also: For once, she (at least she) does NOT embody the incarnation of disparaging arrogance. She is NOT someone who mercilessly pursues her own interests without regard for human losses. In the contrary, there is a healthy dose of humility, because even in old age she is still close to the very simple roots of her origins. This is also because her homeland is in what is now North Korea. She remains aware of the painful separation throughout her successful life. No amount of money can turn back time or realign the political structures. Like that, she embodies a vicarious pain shared by many family histories across the country. And so an emotional bridge is practically built to the audience - halmoni gets some sympathy.The plot has actually enormous potential: the grandson from North Korea, for whom the now old and terminally ill chairman longs in her last remaining weeks and months, was actually found. However, his personality seemingly doesn't lend itself to a peaceful happy ending - and so an actor who is versed in the North Korean dialect is introduced into the family as a fake grandson instead. He does his job so well that he ends up doubting his own identity...""Curtain Call"" manages to play out some of its punchlines in an emotional sensitive way. Nevertheless, the story remains more harmless than necessary and the potential isnt realized. The KDrama doesn't take its chances, instead prefers to choose warm colors and soft images. All in all, ""Curtain Call"" might find its own pitch in the KDrama orbit, yet it keeps a low profile along the way and unfortunately does not take the next step. It rather remains kind-hearted and thus gambles away a dramaturgical chance. In my opinion, more STING really wouldn't have hurt. Too bad.Nevertheless: ""Curtain Call"" is nice to watch. The cast is top notch. In places razor-sharp and at the same time pointedly funny, the KDrama also operates (especially against the background of the North-South dynamic) in a good mood with small socio-critical side swipes here, there and over there as well. The dialogues exploit this potential with relish. The bottom line is that ""Curtain Call"" is probably worth seeing if you DONT feel like too much excitement, revenge, action, thriller, legal affairs or romance."

It will make you think about the present reality and a lot of what ifs.At first I actually mistaken this for a movie because tsunami/earthquake movies became trending on Western movies but I discovered it has 20 episodes so I was hesitant at first but when I watched the first episode, it already hooked me. The plot is really interesting. A bit downside, some parts of it are a bit cliche like where there is a corrupt doctor who always go against that selfless doctor who wanna save everybody. Good thing is that some of the characters are like half villain and hero. It creates variance and also makes the story interesting. Most medical dramas are always about romance most of the time, the love line between colleagues and such but D-Day is unique since disaster is a serious matter,  it always comes first. The romance are indicated little by little so you crave for more. The romantic scenes became more cheesy as ever. Romance aside, this drama is very touching as well.

If you are looking for a comedy this is not the place to look,  even if  it does use quite a bit of humour this is certainly a drama dealing with some pretty heavy issues  and will probably make you feel a whole lot of anger, sorrow and may even make you cry.  The early episodes will probably make you laugh too but the further you get the deeper the issues and by the fifth episode you will have been close to tears, kept on your toes and angry at the world. What I love about this drama, besides the obvious presence of Jung Hae In, is that they dare to show the complexity to  the characters, how one thing leads to another and tackle important issues such as bullying, suicide, group mentality, domestic violence, poverty and the all important bystanders in a beautiful way  by using all means available. Music, cinematography, lighting all work perfectly to set the mood and  are just up my alley. So I rated it with ten stars. However you should know this is my type of drama and I am extremely bias towards Jung Hae In. But if you like me enjoy issues, dark humor and Jung Hae In this drama will leave you hoping for a second season, and thinking it was way to short ,  they should have given it at least 10 episodes instead of the short 6.

I don't know where to start because right now I am experiencing all kinds of emotions. D.P.2 didn't disappoint, it was actually a level up from Season 1.I didn't watch Season 1 when it aired as I was very hesitant to watch military style drama, but when I watched it in 2022, it instantly became my favorite. After that, I eagerly waited for Season 2, and finally, I can say Season 2 was actually worth the wait. Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off, showing the aftermath of the Suk Bong incident and its impact on the lead characters, especially Han Ho Yul, who is dealing with PTSD. The incidents in Season 2 escalate to the point where our D.P. Jun Ho hinself becomes a deserter to expose the harsh realities of the military.Each and every story left a very, very deep impression on me. I can relate to the main victims in each story and feel their pain. None of them deserved what they went through, and they all deserved a happy ending, but unfortunately, they didn't get one. The perpetrators totally ruined the victims lives, and the last scene itself showed the reality of it when Suk Bong was still hospitalized while his perpetrator Jang Soo, was enjoying his life. That scene totally broke me.My favorite story in Season 2 has to be Jang Seong Min's story, who underwent an identity change to become Nina. The guy was a theatre artist who used to play female characters, which led his seniors to bully him in military and eventually run away from the military. He was on the run for years, living a difficult life, and when he finally got chance to make his career outside the country to escape this hell, D.P. started chasing him. He got injured and died due to excessive blood loss. This story has to be one of the most heartbreaking in the D.P. franchise after Suk Bong's story.All the stories in this season felt like they were speaking to the world, showing the suffering they endured. Every story made me teary eyed.I have no prior experience of military service, but I can totally, totally feel the pain of those who have gone through such pain after joining the military.I love how South Korea never shies away from showing the realities of the military. If some other country had tried this concept, Im sure this show must have been banned long ago for insulting the military. But honestly, we need such shows to shed light on the harsher realities of the military.In this season, Captain Im Ji Seop's character saw significant development, from a grey character in Season 1 to a totally positive character in Season 2. He came a long way. The way he and his wife Lieutenant Colonel Seo Eun tried to expose the realities of the military and prevent such incidents from happening was commendable. I really didn't think he would go to such lengths to help the D.P.s. His bromance with Sergeant Park Beom Goo was damn good, which was another new aspect from Season 2 that I enjoyed.Jun Ho's character also underwent significant growth, from being unable to do anything for victim deserters to finally trying to help them. It was a really big growth for him character-wise. Jung Hae In's acting in the last two episodes was exceptional. He is totally born for this character.Han Ho Yul is definitely my favorite. Every time he mostly shows his comic side, but the Suk Bong incident left a big scar on him as he was dealing with PTSD, which showed how sensitive he is. But even with such seriousness, he really never failed to make me laugh in various situations.The victim characters of the various stories actually stole the show, from Kim RuRi to his mother to Jang Seong Min to Ah Wi; everyone's acting was just a chef's kiss. All of them deserve to win awards for their performances.Even the villain characters Gu Ja Woon and Oh Min Woo made you hate them to the core, which proves how good actors they are. In the end, neither the deserters' victims get full justice nor do their pleas remain unheard.

You want to know what happens to the girl and you want her to get back at her bully. However, that revenge plot did not give the satisfaction that one should hope for. Part of it is due to the short length. And that could have been a solid excuse, cause, yes, this is a web drama and one should not expect it to give you an in-depth representation of the story if other short web dramas had handled their stories (some of them quite similar to this one) so nicely that the viewer didn't felt their short length.

There was  a scene when Moo Hak was in confrontation with his father after a big incident that really touched me - that as a son, he is willing to sacrifice for his father's happiness.If there is one thing that I wish to be changed is how they handled Jang Tae In, because he was likeable at the beginning and it felt that they made him do atrocious things just to make people like Moo Hak better.Totally recommendable. 8 out of 10 stars."

This show had such an amazing opportunity to mix crime investigation with supernatural elements, and they decided to ruin it by adding tons of boring plotlines that had less than satisfying conclusions. Imagine this, the show focuses on Lee Hwa Sun, as she tries to catch the serial killer that murdered her husband while the end of the world is happening. Instead of giving us paralel plotlines, make it more procedural - her meeting different types of survivors in different places while investigating. Keeping it rather simple is the way to go with a short format like that.What we actually got were boring characters with typical stories, and literally no valid resolution for any plotline. Props for the writers to be willing to kill the characters, but even that was not satisfying at all, since I was not attached to any of them. The whole mutants/zombie/alien deal: dont waste screen time on plots trying to figure out what it is, if you wont deliver any answers. How about redistributing that time to develop the characters more so I can actually give a shit about what is going on?  Conflicts resolution? Lets just find a cheap way to either write it off, or deal with it in one clean way, no matter if its just lazy writing. ALL the conflicts (and I truly mean ALL) were resolved in the EXACTLY same way. What was the purpose of Yoo Tae Han even existing in this show? No idea. He had no personality, no clear motivation, no goals, no nothing. He just showed up whenever convenient to help the good guys. Its hard to even comment on the acting, when the majority of the characters had little personality or were the typical stereotypical assholes. Song Sang Eun did the best and had the most diversity of the emotional performances from the whole cast. Overall: Honestly speaking, its not a bad show, but its just amazingly frustrating because it could have been so much better. We do not get fresh and fun new concepts that often, so for it to be wasted like that does not sit well with me. I watched it being mildly entertained, but I kept thinking how every scene and plot line could have been easily improved."

This drama looks all fluffy and sweet on the outside with its flowers and smiles but ones you get near the characters the fluff disappears and you get some pretty real humans, that you find yourself wanting to throw off a cliff... Ok maybe not all of them and maybe not a cliff but still... There is something about most of the characters that just got under my skin and even if most of them also had good moments and interesting stories  very few of them where actually lovable... On paper this drama is prefect, the cast is amazing and well casted. The acting is flawless, the OST fits, the cinematography too,..  there is some pretty good and powerful dialog, and I would say the writing and directing feels real and high quality in some way... The story touches some pretty important issues too. So part of me would love to say this is just the perfect drama... It is divers and finally tells the stories of elderly people, stories that are seldom told and I want to see more of.  Also showing some pretty admirable and amazing friendships that have lasted for so many years... But no matter how great this drama is when I try to look at it objectively. it failed in entertaining me and making the story relatable for me. Or was it I that failed?   No matter how much I loved parts of it and wanted to love this drama I could not do it. Honestly I found myself pissed of about 90% of the time, feeling bad for some and wanting to shake some sense in to others... + just say run away, run away... Though I could relate to some of the stories told, the way they handled it got my blood boiling .  the pace is slow and I honestly think you could watch part of it in 1,5 speed without noticing. Another thing that kept bothering me was that the story was told about these women from they writers perspective and not so much their own, I  guess I would have wanted to hear more from the elderly and the people with disabilities that are shown  in the drama. Also The main mother daughter relationship shown here is really toxic, and just terrible, the drama would have been so much better without it.   Even though this has a lot of elements that bothered me, I still think this drama is worth watching and therefor do recommend it."

Yes, such people can come across as frustrating at times which is why many dislike the female lead. However, the reality is that it is not easy to change without help.Though the ending is simplified, the series tries to explain that the female lead was in fact loved. She just couldn't understand acts of care as a love language and was slowly starting to understand it. The series ended the way it did is because finally she had to learn to love herself first before she can accept someone else's love completely.

There is so much back and forth time jumps. Aft first, I found it hard to keep track on how far they were going back as the story takes you back to different years following the story of both the victims of the scam as well as the fraudsters. After a while, I just stopped caring and just wanted the story to move forward.2. Most of the story takes place in flashback. It would be easier if we got the back story and then saw the person in the present. They would show you a dead body and you would have no idea who they are. Then after awhile they would go backwards in time with reference to the dead person and I found myself thinking. ""Okay, this person is dead so why do I need to care what their role was?"" I wasn't invested in them anymore. I wish we got to see their back story first.3. The whole tone of the show is dull. The scenes shot in the present have a blue filter and the past is in a yellow/orange filter. The way the actors speak all feel a bit monotonous especially our lead detective.4. Again because the story is working backwards, I didn't feel a connection to the victims early on. I wasn't fully empathetic to their suffering. Instead I was impatient to figure out if they will get their justice in the present but instead I was forced to go back to the past every time something interesting happened in the present.5. It also adds to the frustration that the lead detective keeps undermining the victims of scam saying it's not a big deal compared to murder and refusing to look into any possible connection to things happening in the present. At the same time, he wants to get information out of them while also name-calling them. The last thing you want the male lead to be is a jerk and those are the vibes that I got from him.6. Just when the series was getting somewhere in the present, it ended. I am okay with splitting shows up but for Decoy, it doesn't work in it's favour. Maybe my impression of the show would be better if it was complete rather than being divided in this way.What I liked:1. The female lead who plays the reporter. She is clearly a smart character. Smarter than the detective in fact and she picks up on things fairly quickly. Acts in the nick of time and was the main reason I enjoyed this series.2. The only person I developed some sympathy for was the ""oppa"" of the female lead even though he didn't get much of a role. Rather there were only glimpses of him.3. No Sang Cheon, the con artist. Loved his character. He feels more like a grey character than a pure bad guy. To some extent, I admire his wits for catching on to a scam. That's a different matter that he turns into a scamster himself. He also seems to be the only character that actually portrays the widest range of emotions and has enthusiasm when he speaks.Even 6 episodes took me a long time to cover as I would start feeling sleepy so to prevent that I had to watch the show in 2x. I will watch part 2 just for the conclusion and I hope it will be more focused on the present for a change."

However, in a normal 16 episoder, there is the rest of the series will carry through usually as the mid season hump passes (usually by epi 8) when they're setting up for a thrilling finale.However, even though Part 1 was only 2 months ago, that's forever in dramaland. I have probably have watched at least 20 to 30 dramas since. And now resuming Part 2, I have forgotten whatever happened in Part 1. And I have little interest in re-watching it to remind myself of what happened (it wasn't THAT interesting the first time). I'm faced with characters who are strangers to me and we're thrust straight into the action with a recap. ""Who's this? what happened last time? What was going? Who was involved in the conspiracy?""The 2-parter also meant that the story was going around in repetitive circles. However, it got there in the end with some solid twists in the last 2 episodes, and that's the only reason I am still giving it an 8 overall. Because of the intermission between the 2 parts, I was about to drop the series during episode 7 because it was too much mental work trying to work out who was who. If I had done so, I wouldn't have seen that the show redeemed itself in the end."

I remember that while it was airing and everybody was talking about it, I used to look at it with greedy eyes everyday. I wanted to watch it so bad but at the same time, I knew that in order to enjoy it fully I needed to wait for completion. I'm glad I waited 'cause I truly can't comprehend how I would have withstood the torture that this show's cliffhangers inflicted upon the poor watchers.

If you're like me and you've watched your fair share of crime dramas you won't find the premise of this show exactly unique. You'll be able to guess most of the plot twists (if not all) and see a lot of things coming beforehand. Defendant comes with it's flaws. There are a lot of convenient coincidences that aid both our good guys and the baddies. Sharp tools just happen to be lying around jail cells just waiting to be used by the inmates, a circuit somehow just happens to break resulting in a power black out whenever it is needed, a very useful recording device disguised as a pen just happens to travel around wringing confessions from the evil doers left and right and our antagonist somehow conveniently transforms from an up to no good loser to an identity stealing mastermind overnight. 
How very interesting.

However, with its slightly rocky plot comes a masterful execution. Even though you know what's going to happen, when it actually happens it feels like a completely new and exciting experience. Our good guys seem to be trapped in their own version of real life flappy bird. It's one step forward from the abyss of doom and twenty steps backwards. So when convenient coincidences happen to rule things in their favor, I'd be damned if I have a problem with it. 

This is the kind of show that banks on the watcher's heart rather than the mind. It will make you blinded with emotion and leave all logic behind. But the real reason this show is a hit is the excellent acting put out by all the actors. 

Ji Sung as always is phenomenal. From Secret to Kill Me Heal Me and finally to Defendant, you can see his acting evolve and grow more powerful. He's an extremely skilled performer and many a times I suffered through a serious case of gooseflesh while watching him. By the middle of this show I was completely invested, horribly torn apart and crossing my fingers for him to turn the tables on all the assholes that had done him wrong. 

Usually in melodramas, when you see the main character go through tragedy after tragedy, it turns from heartbreaking to frustrating real quick. Soon you go from wanting to wipe the hero's tears to slapping his mouth shut and putting an end to the sob fest. However, Ji Sung got me every time. His pain, helplessness and tears always made me wail like a baby. I didn't realize I was rocking so much H2O in my body until it came out gushing from my peepers. I think I felt quite a lot dehydrated after finishing this show.

Uhm Ki-Joon with his Cha Min Ho put out the acting of his life. He's heartless, ruthless, evil without a cause and at last, pitiful. He's probably one of the best antagonists of Dramaland and undoubtedly one of the most hated characters. His impulsive acts of violence leave you shaking with fury and you'll find yourself thirsty for his demise. 
A lot of people thought that his situation was a little unrealistic but as a daughter of a detective, I can say that I've seen many real life cases where the criminals start with seemingly minor and thoughtless crimes and commit far worse atrocities to cover it up. In Cha Min Ho's case, he sticks to it to the very end. His bag of tricks is endless and you never find a peaceful moment with him.

Even though this show truly focuses on the two main men, some other characters will weasel their way in your heart and take permanent residence. These were the characters that I wanted to hide in my back pocket and protect from all the cruelty of the world. And even though my wishful thinking did not save all of them, I treasured every moment they were on-screen. 
My precious and loyal Seong Kyu, my shady but hilarious Optimus Shin Cheol Sik, Prosecuter Choi Tae Hong who never once lost faith, Jeong Woo's merry band of prison inmates and the resilient Seo Eun Hye all brought their own flavor to the show.

This drama has a deep underlying message about how family makes or breaks you. How people are willing to go to every length to save their loved ones and how it's never too late for justice. With an extremely satisfying ending; giving closure to all the characters and answer to your every question, Defendant takes a spot among dramas that are consistently amazing from start to finish.

A dark and gritty suspense drama that comes with its share of heartbreak.

An absolute must-watch"

Working with Sam Soo is Lee Yoo Kyung, who, despite a silver-spoon upbringing, is a brave, justice-seeking rookie whose first scoop is Tae Yong's victorious retrial case.

This drama had a lot of sincerity and heart, without being too preachy.3. We know there are really a lot of corrupt people in the government, from the police, prosecutors, mayors to judges.

I loved the ensemble cast, from the 4 main baddies to Tae Yong's tight circle of friends.5. Also loved the last minute cameos of Lee Jong Hyuk, Lee Elijah and Lee Jung Jae.Dislikes1. The drama spent too much time on the truck murder case, almost 10 episodes that sometimes there were too much flashbacks, too much rehashed scenes and conversations (How many times did i near I'm Han Sang Man??"" I wished they kept the drama at 16 episodes (18 at most) instead of 20.2. The final episode was okay but too convenient. The Seungwoo principal and director easily apologized to everyone. Also it felt like they didnt really take down the bad guys. Im sure they'll be back after the publicity has died down. So goes back to what did Taeyong and Samsoo actually accomplish? 3. I thought Tae Yong wanted to change the system that's why he is running for a seat in Jongno, but he ended up foregoing the chance and work on the ground. It was okay but he will never change the system if he stays small. Let Samsoo do the ground work and he goes up the chain.Rating: 8/10"

There's also a brief rehash of the previous episode and credits. All told, there's only about a dozen minutes of legitimate content and a good chunk of that is incoherently edited fighting set pieces. The main culprit is that there's just no dialogue. Without lines for the actors and almost entire episodes with no forward plot movement, even an 8 minute episode is tiresome.

This show is extra cheesy, and honestly I love cheese! Unfortunately, I am also kinda lactose intolerant, so after eating a certain amount of cheese I am left with regrets, and a stomach ache. That's exactly how I felt after watching the last episode. *Cue the rage of a thousand fans* 

I think the biggest problem I had with this show is that it tried to mix in three genres without a coherent plot to bring it all together. It's part rom-com, part military drama, and part hospital sitcom. The love story is probably what makes most people excited about the show, the military scenes are a cool action bonus, and the hospital sitcom keeps things from getting too heavy and depressing. Unfortunately, because the script is so weak, I was too disconnected to keep caring about the show, and it started to become very boring. I kept watching for one reason only Song Joong Ki.

Song Joong Ki is oddly cast in a lot of ways. He has a super baby face, and boyish charm, but still managed to be a believable bad@ss soldier. I would easily rate his character/acting 10. Not only did I develop a 16 episode crush on him, but I really cared about his assignments. The show would have been a million times more enjoyable for me if they just let his story be the center, or rather, the bromance between Shi Jin, and Dae Yeong.  Their relationship was my favorite part of the show. Their characters didn't have much depth individually, but their bromance was solid.

There is also great chemistry between Song Joong Ki, and Song Hye Kyo, but not much to their overall story. Every moment with them is exactly the same - they flirt, they separate, she gets mad, he's extra charming, they flirt again. Early on, I really started to dislike Dr. Kang Mo Yeon, which made it hard to sympathize with her anger at him. Eventually I started to like her a little more, but no matter how cute their flirty scenes, or how strangely amusing their brink of death dating was, their story is still repetitive, which gets old quick. 

The 2nd leads also had a romance, that had a few more obstacles thrown their way (parents, distance, almost dying), but was just as repetitive - fight, confess, spontaneous affection, fight. It's like each story  just filled in the same blanks for each episode. It was actually the older minor characters who had the most interesting love story. I thought Seo Jeong Yeon and Lee Seung Jun were really cute, and deserve an honorable mention. 

The supporting cast was pretty good. Some were much better than others, and some were almost completely useless (the head of the hospital... that ditzy doctor... ugh). I had to bring the acting down to an 8 because of that, but the cast is really the only good thing this show has going for it.

What was the point of this drama? At first it seemed like a way to show how hard it can be to date a soldier, but because the show didn't take itself seriously, it was hard for me to take that too seriously, even with that emotionally manipulative 15th episode. The conflicts at the hospital were ridiculous, and mostly filler. The best episodes took place when the medical staff went overseas to Urk, but once that was over, the show seemed to have no clue what to do. Did they run out of travel budget, so they decided to just wing it for the last episodes? Even in Urk, the plot was super predictable, and totally unrealistic, but it was still very entertaining (yummy Cheese!!!). When they returned, my feelings about the show went downhill, and I was no longer excited about watching the next episode. Then suddenly things got very serious out of nowhere, only to end with the silliest (and worst) last episode I've ever seen in any drama (yes THE worst!). I wonder if episode 15 was the original ending, and then it was changed last minute to avoid a backlash. That's the only thing I can think of as an explanation for why it was so bad.

The music? meh. The scenery? epic. The english spoken? decent. The shirtless men running? Daebak.

Would I rewatch? Not unless someone makes an edited version of only scenes with Song Joong Ki.

Overall It's like they rolled a kdrama dice and just threw stuff in at random to get people hooked, then they just focused on all the ways they can successfully incorporate product placement. Maybe that was the real point, to see how many ads they could sneak into a drama.

Even though there were moments I really enjoyed, I can't recommend this drama, especially after sitting through that ending. I wish they cut it down to 10 episodes, removing all the unnecessary fluff, and sneaky ads (subway, hyundai, make up, coffee, snacks, hiking equipments, travel apps... umm... except for the self driving car, because that scene was actually cool ) then maybe it would be a drama worthy of all the hype.

Or maybe you can treat my review like lactaid. Now that you know what to expect, maybe you can better digest all the cheese this show has to offer."

It sure is not mine. Yet, here I am, loving this drama and recommending it to everyone. And here's why...STORYWould I call it realistic? Not really. Did it bother me that it was unrealistic? No. Why? Because it was cohesive and consistent. I know that political dramas can be boring for people who are just not interested in the topic, and that's why adding some unrealistic, but definitely grabbing the attention plot points made this drama more approachable for a wider audience. The main point of the drama was the development and growth of the characters. It's a story of believing in yourself and what you stand for, fighting for the right. Discovering that just because there are winners, does not necessarily mean there must be losers. How to play the game that will make not only you achieve your goals, but also make everyone around you content. It's about slowly realizing your strengths and ways to use them. Figuring out that wanting something does not necessarily make you a bad person who is only led by greed. Many interesting lessons to learn with our main character. An amazing journey of self-discovery.CHARACTERS & CASTI was not sold on the idea of Ji Jin Hee being the lead of the whole drama. Especially after watching the first two episodes. Him being surrounded by all the strong and captivating side characters made me worried, if he can truly lead the whole show. And oh boy, I was wrong. Now I would say he was born for this role and he aced the character. Seeing Park Moo Jin slowly grow  without giving up on his principles and beliefs was an amazing journey. It was refreshing to see a really smart main character that was also empathetic and, to put it simply, a good person.It's also worth mentioning other characters that won my heart: Cha Young Jin, whom I loved to hate at the beginning and then just simply loved. Han Na Kyung who was the MVP of the badass team. Oh Young Seok, who made the drama even more thrilling to watch. Yoon Chan Kyung who was the true politician - I never knew where she was standing and what her motives were. Is she good? Is she bad? I guess you will find out for yourself, if you decide to watch it.OTHERThe show also talks about some serious issues in a realistic and not patronizing way. It helps with understanding the reasoning for specific choices characters make. The cinematography and the way it was shot was beautiful. Definitely a high quality production. The music was good; it was not exactly grabbing my attention, but it's a political drama, the ost is not the main focus here. The ending was perfect, and everything I could wish for.Overall, I did not expect to like this drama as much as I did, but it will probably stay as one of my favorites."

Real situations faced by everyone in their lives are shown in a little funny yet serious way. The relation between ML and his wife and ML and his family doctor are so wholesome. Ep1 brought me back to the time when I was hearing about a lot of layoffs. ML is a vice president of a company who is given the news that he is gonna be laid off, so the earlier he accepts it, the bigger the compensation will be. This ep will show the 5 stages of grief, denial, anger, negotiation, depression, and acceptance. In this ep, we also get to know that the couple is having a hard time conceiving. We also get to know that ML suffers from insomnia, and when he has a get-together with his friends, he gets quite intimate by hearing how they own their own house, how they invest in stocks, and so on. So he starts to learn about stocks and starts investing, and as I guessed, he starts losing money in it. It had such a good reality point that when some employees are laid off, some of them might think that rather than working to get hired, they may find a simple way to earn since they are desperate for money, and in the end, all the savings they have also ends up going to waste( not saying that stock investments are bad, but if invested without having any proper knowledge about the market, investment can pretty much be a bad idea). Then, there is a scene where they won the reverse bits for a house, due to payment stress and all, ML develops alopecia (felt bad for ML when his friends we're making fun of him bcoz of his alopecia). Then in the next ep we learn that FL is pregnant and ML gets a job offer from a startup. But due to pressure from the company since it's a start-up and run by youth, ML under pressure starts to spit blood, and even though there are challenges he faces in his job, he is able to overcome all of them and help the startup follow its success path. At the end, the last ep focuses on his health and company, and eventually we can conclude that life is full of challenges, but at the same time, life also gives you support to overcome the challenges, like ML had FL, who supported him even in his hard times.This series is a must-see because it teaches subtle life lessons. This series is a one-time deal, according to me.Let's live, Let's Love and hope you enjoy your time by doing what you love ?"

I guess viewers were supposed to be educated as well as entertained, but they have to be interested first. 
Eight episodes of Investigator Alice was 8 episodes too many. 
K-pop stars are often used by the So Ko show biz industry to attract younger audiences to watch shows where the subject matter may be too complex or just plain boring. However, Kim Nam Joo's acting did nothing to make this show even boring (boring being a step up from the snoozefest it is). 
This show had no pulse, as she flatlined through every episode.
The only take away from this train wreck is that Kim Nam Joo has set the bar pretty low for future K-pop stars to make the transition from singing to acting (or whatever it is she was doing).

On the outside, he looks a bit slow and like he has no ambitions in life, but his inner self is different from what he appears on the outside.Cha Myung Joo is an elite prosecutor, who was rising on the ladder of success at the Central District Prosecutor’s Office before being sent to a branch office.(Source: HanCinema, Soompi)","Jeon Sung Woo, Jung Ryeo Won, Kim Kwang Gyu, Lee Sang Hee, Lee Sun Kyun, Lee Sung Jae",jTBC,"An undiscovered treasure.  This drama is wonderfully unique and the only other drama I can think of to compare it with is Misaeng; but set in the public service rather than the corporate world. It begins as a quintessential comedy of manners; beautifully observed and very funny. There is no slapstick, forced humour or conscious jokes it is all situational comedy requiring an appreciation of what-is-not-said from the viewer. The smile hardly left my face for the first 5 episodes and I often had to stop streaming because I was laughing too much to read the subs.This is the type of drama that someone who has worked for a while can really appreciate. The office politics are just wonderful and understanding them is 50% of the humour. If you have worked in a setting that interfaces with the public, or community/social work, then the scenarios in this drama will be delightfully reminiscent of how reality can often be more absurd than fiction. The storyline was taken from a book by a rural prosecutor about his experiences and it has retained a very firm grip on reality.The skilled and acute observation of the writer, the subtle portrayals by the actors and the understated direction tell a very human story, on one side of fraught repressed emotions, petty rivalries, oneupmanship, self delusion, bullying, jealousy and misjudgement; and on the other side, of compassion, dignity, forgiveness, generosity, loyalty, friendship and support.The story features the relationships and strategies that most people adopt in order to make life easy enough to bear and is mostly about people for whom climbing the ladder is not the most important thing in their life.  They just want to keep their heads down, ensure that their salaries drop into their bank accounts every month, and do enough of a good job to keep themselves from being noticed. But underneath there lies a streak of obstinate courage.The drama starts with everyone just muddling along in comfortable complacency when the supercharged tornado of Cha Myeong Joo breezes in from Seoul to shake up their world. Ambitious, arrogant, abrasive, smug and beautifully played by Jung Ryeo Won, she divides opinion but completely rubs Lee Sun Woong up the wrong way. He is brilliantly portrayed by Lee Sun Kyun and is the notional protagonist. Over the course of the sixteen episodes, through various scenarios of conflict, competition and grudging co-operation, we see the heart that lies beneath the surface of both of these characters. Essentially though, this is an ensemble piece and all of the leads are praiseworthy with no weak links. Each one has their own story and is featured at some point in the show.The drama presents a variety of case scenarios, sometimes using the lives of the main characters. They vary from the truly tragic to the totally ridiculous and the action can switch from comedy to pathos in a heartbeat. The vein of social commentary that lies underneath brings a serious and compassionate note to the drama adding another layer of richness. As with most Kdramas, corruption rears its head and the resultant cost to everyone is movingly revealed.The production values on this show are pretty standard and the music is upbeat in the main, borrowing some latin-style rhythms. What sets it apart is a fabulous script and some really top notch performances.As the show is episodic in nature there is no need to binge it. On the contrary, it is something to be savoured. It has short plot lines that can be munched through a couple of episodes at a time. So curl up on the sofa with your favourite tipple and enjoy the feast along with the cast who eat their way through a mountain of food. A perfect show for a Sunday night.I was really surprised at the low viewing figures and the lack of reviews in English for this show on MDL. I totally fell in love with it and have rated it really highly for its entertainment value and delicious humour. If you are finding it hard to find, then on VIKI at least, search for it under the title War of Prosecutors. It comes highly recommended.What my rating means: 9+  A drama I totally fell in love with and is endlessly re-watchable. It ticked all the boxes and had some serious wow factor. It would go on my personally recommended list."
Different Dreams,,,2750,2019.0,2019.0,40,,,,"A turning point in Korean history, one never to be forgotten is presented in this engaging historical drama, celebrating its 100th anniversary. In 1919, during the Japanese colonial period, two events paved the way for the independence of Korea, the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the Korean Provisional Government. And with it, a covert armament for freedom was born, the Heroic Corps. Historically and in the drama, the man leading the corps goes by the name of Kim Won Bong, his real name only a few people know. He rarely stays in one area for more than two hours and sleeps for only short periods at a time. With fiery passion in his heart, he moves about swiftly and dreams for his country's independence. Lee Young Jin a Korean woman raised by a Japanese military doctor follows in her adopted father's footsteps, and through a series of events, attends a prestigious medical university in Shanghai. She returns to Joseon and becomes the first female surgeon. The two of them cross paths, and although they follow different ideologies, Won Bong soon realizes his need for her and begins to regret sending her deep into enemy territory. These two characters will walk together, sometimes run, sometimes fall, only to get back up again to chase their dreams. Bearing with them the pain and suffering of the historical events that shaped Korea's independence, they hope to instil the past so that it will never be forgotten.(Source: Viki)","Im Joo Hwan, Lee Hae Young, Lee Yo Won, Nam Gyu Ri, Yoo Ji Tae, Yoon Jong Hwa",MBC,"Plot armor? Do they come in grey?  Somewhat short thoughts, not much i want to touch on besides the fact this is the most underrated drama Ive been blessed coming across. From months of collecting dust on my watch list to weeks of stalling episodes as I didnt want this series to end... sigh, to be fair the covers do not do this drama the justice it deserves in grabbing attention.An extremely well written and compact story delivered at an explosive like pace. Characters so interesting and unique from one another youre bound to find yourself rooting for the wrong sides every now and then. Strong and morally grey characterization making almost every death worth mentioning, farewell, betrayal, and new alliances a very impactful watch. Now beware and/or also take a breath of relief, this drama loves its plot armor, and it doesnt discriminate, while also  showing its capability of finishing what was started. Have a specific favorite ally or foe? 9/10 youll be fully satisfied with whatever fate they come to, rather its before they meet their end, a grand return, an epic shootout saving an ally, bullet sponges, bombing party, survival of the written, you name it. Different Dreams is a rich historically filled work of art. A series that makes the absolute  most out of its comparatively small budget to popular hit dramas like Mr.Sunshine. A very dark and gritty tone wrapped around immersive struggles for independence, power,  and peace. A must try for any historical fanatics out there. A memorable journey and new personal favorite worth much more acknowledgement and praise."
Dinner Mate,,,2224,2020.0,2020.0,32,,,,"A young woman going through a rough breakup with a long-time boyfriend and a man who had a painful first love, meet unexpectedly on Jeju Island.

When they dine out, they keep their private lives to themselves, not even disclosing their names. Due to a series of odd coincidences they find themselves meeting in unexpected situations. Or is fate sending them a message? (Source: MyDramaList)~~ Adapted from the webtoon ""Would You Like To Have Dinner Together?"" (저녁 같이 드실래요?) by Park Shi In (박시인).","Kim Seo Kyung, Lee Ji Hoon, Seo Ji Hye, Son Na Eun, Song Seung Heon, Ye Ji Won",iQiyi MBC,"Not Good Enough   "" Dinner Mate "" started smoothly, but quickly started dragging.The first few episodes of the drama were interesting. It was a fun ride to watch the main characters meet by chance again and again, but being ignorant of who they were in reality (him being the doctor the girl was trying to track down and her being the broadcasting employee whom he was trying to avoid). That scene with the cheating boyfriend on the island was pure entertainment as well and it gave the couple a solid start. Finally, the female lead was one of the best characters of the drama, as she was unconventional for Korean drama standards, dynamic, strong opinioned, and a delight to watch till the very final episode. In addition, the story of the homeless man and the director of the broadcasting company was quite interesting and sweet.However, the drama started lagging after those first episodes. It was disappointing to discover that, even though the description and the name itself indicated that the couple will bond over food, there were few to non foodie moments. So why go with that concept if you aren't going to use it? Just say that is about people with exes and emotional problems that heal each other. I mean, I get this is based on a manhwa which probably used the two characters as dinner mates, but the drama did not. Also, speaking about the exes, they were okay at first, but they got way too annoying. In addition, the introduction of them wasn't smooth when it came to the female lead. We first saw her going on a surprise trip, hoping to get proposed by her boyfriend, so she clearly was over her, let's call him main ex. But no, another one was thrown to us out of nowhere. I mean, the male lead was straight forward about his ex girlfriend and his feelings for her. But for the girl, the whole situation was messy. However, that was not the main problem with the exes. It was interesting that they had a background story to boot their motives, but they were way too obsessive, especially the girl's ex, and that got tiring after a while, as she kept telling him that she was over him and he just kept bothering her.Also, the main romance was boring. They didn't start on romantic premises, which was a relief and refreshing. However, they became a couple a bit too rushly and that did not help with the built-up of the love story. The drama got boring too, as the story repeated cliche trops when it came to the main plot.So, overall, four out of ten."

Discipline was chaotic, dynamic, thoughtful, and engaging from beginning to end. In terms of story, an over-arching plot loosely connects this mini-series, but I also think that each episode can be viewed as a stand-alone that focuses on a day in the life of one of the characters. Speaking of characters, I enjoyed all of them. Each had their own distinct personalities, and the way they cared for one another was really nice. The actors did a great job portraying each one. The dialogue was smooth and natural, and the writing overall was well-executed.The only complaints that I have revolve around time constraints. Oh how I wish these episodes were longer or that we got more of them. I would love to spend more time with these characters and delve into their stories more deeply. As is, it felt like we got stories that were mostly complete but a bit rushed through or glossed over. I felt like some much-needed backstory was missing to really give this series depth it deserved. I also felt like the ending was a little abrupt and didn't offer the resolution/closure I was hoping for, as well as felt a bit idealistic. Still, for what I'm guessing was a limited budget based on number and length of episodes, the series was really well done and I think offered more than some series that are twice as long.Needless to say, this was a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and this is a drama I'd definitely recommend."

Beyond words can describe this series. It is one of the most thought-provoking series I have ever seen. In addition, it is an amazing and an astounding story of life in its most esoteric form. If I tried to describe this series, it would be an almost impossible task as it traverses common reference points and twists life into knots. While the title implies this has something to do with vampires, it does not.  But it does have some elements of what the outcome of being a vampire. There is some stunning dialogue in here about life that makes it so worth watching. On the other hand, there is some of the worst acting (not by any of the major stars, however) I have ever seen for the English speaking parts. But, honestly, this was a guilty pleasure of mine that overall, I liked. This barely qualifies as a BL series but the relationship is just so charming and full of hope.

This show had the potential to be a neat little show, but while the basic idea was decent for a short film (girl likes the slightly older student tutoring her and tries to figure out whether the other one likes her), the editing was confusing. I had difficulty telling what was the present, what was a dream, what was a flashback or a flashforward. It jumped around a bit too much in a way that many it was hard to get a coherent story. The actresses, especially the one who's supposed to be the younger one, looked too old for their roles, something but aided by the make-up, which took me out of the story even more. It's a shame because as I said, the storyline is simple enough that we could get a solid shirt film out of it. I wouldn't discourage you from watching.

Very thoughtfully written. This drama seemed to be breaking stereotypes and showing us the journey of a woman who was finding herself after years of very subtle abuse (read subtle here). But then this drama became a total mess. The writers focused on giving us cliches after cliches. The character growth and arcs did not happen. The same story kept being repeated over and over again. The same scenario (the lady needing transplant) repeated again. Peoples emotions and feelings (when they got hurt) were trivialised and passed off as comedy. The cheator and the people who did wrong things (well nothing happened to them). I am just angry with myself for even watching this drama. PS : the acting of all of the cast is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful I thought this drama might be the Anupama of Korean dramas but alas we got something really really banal.

Doctor Detective touches on the sensitive and controversial topic of industrial corruption and the focus of profit with disregard to the health and life of others. Sadly, it adds other plot lines, mixing the stories of everyday people with conflicts arising among the elites.Honestly, with the heartbreaking cases of industrial accidents, negligence from the companies and the fight for justice done by UDC, why would anyone care about the power struggle of the higher-ups in the TL and the business politics? The TL side of the story should have been nothing more, nothing less than a background story of industrial corruption, without getting too into details about the specifics.The cases that UDC deals with are based on real life events. At the end of the episodes we get epilogues that allow us to see the truth behind them - with footage, photos and interviews of the victims. Truly touching and sad stories, showing how much work still has to be put into bettering the laws.The UDC team is quite perfect. We have the members who are driven and bring the spirits up, ones that use their wits and brain to solve problems, some that bring bits of happiness and jokes. Each and every one of them is unique in their own way, but together they make a perfect team.On the other side, we have everyone related to TL and their fight for the attention of the CEO and future power over the company. And that's where the problem of the drama lies. There was nothing new, interesting, exciting about that plot line.The acting was definitely amazing. Especially liked the high quality of skills from the supporting cast. The sadness, frustration, anger, fear... all these emotions that the victims felt had to be well presented, for the show to work out.Overall, I would suggest watching the show while completely skipping TL scenes. The cases taken by UDC were interesting and knowing they were based on true events, adds to the value of presenting them."

But it's only shown in the first episode and it's a really short clip. We learn the FL develops and instant crush on the ML which is a heavy eye roll for me.Then we see weak plots about different characters exhibiting pain that barely gets covered.One episode has a supposedly virus outbreak but that quickly dwindled.Then the FL learns of the ML's secret and she becomes even more clingy and naggy ( yeah not a word but I can't think of anything else.) She becomes so annoying that I began to look elsewhere when she starts whining and crying over stupid stuff. I had to ask myself is there not ONE episode where's she's not crying and wondering why the ML don't have feelings for her or why he's not showing enough feelings for her?? At different points she made his issue all about her.The next is that prosecutor and nurse. Call me crazy but the way she handled the guy who had anal cancer was so wrong and yet she didn't get in trouble for it and that prosecutor should've been disbarred for trying to get someone who served their time fired. Isn't that harassment? Then out of the blue the ML starts having problems with his health. Episode 1-8 he's doing fine then the next few episodes he's having health problems then close to the end he goes to do some research about his disease. We see he's not doing good then the writers time stamp the last two episodes of making it seem as if three years past and the ML shows up out of the blue and the FL goes into her clingy,  crying, nagging self...again... By this time I'm skipping a lot of her whining and literally stalking the ML because he didn't call her.The last episode was the most let down of all the other episodes. The writers had no where to go and just let the uninspired sappy romance go on forever!!! The other doctor and sister's relationship was more believable than the FL and ML.I like medical dramas and thought this would be a good one but alas, I only watched because I literally had nothing else to do. I just hurried and watched the last few episodes just to get them over with. I could've dropped this but I was curious as to how it would've turned out. With the same three songs being played over and over in each episode, the crying, the sappy uninspiring romance....this has definitely been a medical drama let down for me and is a sign to truly skip dramas that have romance in it. No matter how good it is, if it's got romance in it like this I will avoid it like the plague!"

The show slows down a bit towards the middle albeit I won't say that it's bad but at didn't excite me during those times and I was not eagerly awaiting the next episode.Basic plot summary:Han Yihan is a cardiothoracic surgeon and an exceptional one at that. Unfortunately for him, the head of the hospital uses him for his son's ghost doctor secretly when he is in trouble in the operating room. One day a patient that Han Yihan operated on tragically dies the next morning due to questionable circumstances. The hospital decides to place the entire blame on Yihan under the accusation of medical negligence. With no one on his side and no proof, he is forced to accept blame and his medical license is revoked. 4 years later he emerges as a lawyer who specialises in medical malpractice. This is where our story truly begins.Review:The plot has a very strong start but the story might seem a little cliche as revenge dramas go. But, the true hero of the story is this mysterious character by the name of Jayden Lee who adds unpredictability and spice into the show. Where Han Yihan's seriousness and lack of charisma can lead to detachment from the character and the female lead (prosecutor) leaves much to be desired, Jayden brings drama and suspense. No one really knows or understands his motives. Is he a good guy? Is he pretending? And it is also because of him and the dilemma that he adds that you feel more supportive towards Han Yihan.There is no real romance in this drama from the main leads but Jayden and the second female lead, Im Yoona, have a fun chemistry. Add some jealousy to the mix.I won't give away the finale but the last two episodes, in my opinion, were edge of the seat entertaining. And that is part of the reason why I am willing to give this show a 9. Shows like these deserve an ending on a high note.I don't usually comment on the OST, but Freedom is a nice exciting track. I enjoyed it. Didn't listen to the others.Regarding rewatch value, I would probably speed watch the show or select  some of the major episodes to watch. It's not that high on my priority list. Then again there has only been one revenge drama I've seen twice and that is Taxi Driver which I love and there aren't many shows I would actually watch as of now. I would still recommend Doctor Lawyer at least once for Jayden Lee."

The real saving grace of this show was the acting. Kim Rae Won and Park Shin Hye did a good job for the material they were given. There was some awkwardness in the beginning of the relationship, but then there was complete comfortableness and next to no drama. I wasn't a huge fan of Yoon Gyun Sang at first, but he grew on me through the run (but they definitely could have styled him better). Lee Sung Kyung was believable as a spoiled lonely rich girl. I enjoyed all the supporting characters save the doctor that played Seo Woo's father. He was so childish and immature that I found it hard to believe he was running a hospital. But the actor did a wonderful job of conveying the spirit of the character. He was immensely unlikable. There were lots of great cameos as well, and the most memorable was played by Nam Goong Min - his episodes were some of the better parts of the floundering middle. I wouldn't recommend this drama unless you are just a fan of the actors. There is not really a plot to it at all, and even as a hospital drama it was lacking. While it had a promising start, I only finished it because I was invested in seeing it to the end once I realized that the plot was never going to pick back up and that nothing was really happening to our main characters.

As she tries to keep up the image of ""perfect Rahee"" made up with lies, her first love shows up! Will Rahee be able to keep her secrets till the end? (Source: KOK TV Youtube)","Choi Yeon Soo, Hong Dong Young, Kang Ha Na, Kim Ji Woong, Kim Na Hyun, Kyung Da Eun",Naver TV Cast,"Is  Dont Lie, Rahee  Actually Worth Watching?  Produced as an original miniseries by Naver TV Cast,  Dont Lie, Rahee (   )  is a fairly lighthearted yet niche setup with an abundance predictable cliches  along the way. The series focuses upon the titular female lead and influencer Noh Ra Hee ( Kim Na Hyun). Despite having other 100,000 subscribers and a popular image, Ra Hee struggles to maintain her perfectionism . Instead Ra Hee has turned to fabricating a web of lies in order to boost  her influencer persona. However when a particular lie leads her  to running into childhood friend and her first love Seol Ho-won ( Kim Ji Woong), Ra Hee finds it even harder to keep her hidden secrets  Dont Lie, Rahee is notably a simplistic and lighthearted concept. Whilst  the series was surprisingly compacted into its short duration time of four episodes, this did admittedly present a double-edged sword. A shorter and easygoing setup allowed the miniseries narrative to be  expedited and wrapped up quickly, but it also highlighted a major dilemma also; there was no real sense of impending doom or growth ( even in a short space of time) for the characters. It is important to reiterate that  Dont Lie, Rahees storyline and execution was limited from the outset with only four episodes . On the other hand whilst extended time can be a contributing factor towards writing a detailed and well-executed  plot, certain short stories  and mini dramas have proven time and time again that writing and the usage of plot is key also. One of the most notable things about  Dont Lie, Rahee is that even in a very short space of time, the series often struggled with trying to buildup the dilemma surrounding Rahee. Of course this isnt to say it wasnt apparent from the outset or nonexistent  but aside from some cutesy exchanges between Ho-Won and Rahee onscreen, a multitude of selfies taken by Rahee, or a heart to heart chat with Rahees close friend Go Min-yeong ( Choi Yeon Soo),  it was hard to really pinpoint precise moments ( aside from the final episode) when the storyline really permitted a climatic build or sense of unease for the audience. The acting of the miniseries is admittedly decent enough. There  were admittedlt a few abrupt moments of awkwardly delivered dialogue and interactions but the main cast, specifically Kim Na Hyun and Kim Ji Woong, were certainly charming enough.Former SONAMOO member and actress Kim Na Hyun (  The Miracle,  Caf Kilimanjaro) played main female lead Noh Ha Ree. As a character, Ra Hee is fairly hard for audiences to warm up to. Initially whilst she is supposed to be haughty, fractious and evidently flawed through her multiple shared falsehoods, it was difficult to really feel pity for Ra Hee during seemingly sympathetic moments  in the final part. Perhaps one of the key reasons for viewers feeling somewhat disengaged from this seemingly  quintessential character came through the fact that there were few redeeming moments or even opportunities to see past Ra Hees false pretences early on. Of course throughout the narrative, we are supposed to see Ra Hee  grow by her rekindled  feelings for Ho-won as well as her  confession in the final course of the narrative. On the other hand whilst this did resonate a certain sympathetic tone with audiences, it was hard to really grasp how Ra Hee truly matured or developed as a character, or at least painted in a more sympathetic light early on  by foreshadowing or trying to  build up her storyline subtly more even in a short space of time. Costarring alongside Kim Na Hyun was idol-actor  Kim Ji Woong (  The Sweet Blood,  Kissable Lips) as leading man Seol Ho-Won. Reserved, slightly brooding, good-looking and altruistic, Ho-Woon embodied all of the stereotypical tropes surrounding a main lead and a potential love interest with differing results. Whilst is arguable that Ho-Woon was a  a necessary component for the events of storyline and for Ra Hees character  , Ho-Woon was a shoehorned archetype. He was kindhearted and sweet but aside from his ambivalent feelings for Ra Hee and helping her in different ways, Ho Woon rarely had prominent flaws or at least notable drives as a character.  Instead Ho Woon came across as a carte blanche main male lead; necessary for keeping the plot afloat, but rarely sticking out as a sentient or driven character.On the other hand it is undeniable that the chemistry between lead actors  Kim Na Hyun and Kim Ji Woong was prominent throughout the short series. Despite some limited dialogue and situations, Na Hyun and Ji Woong were able to power through with surprisingly natural and coherent chemistry from beginning to end. The quality of production and filming is admittedly to be expected for a miniseries. ( Although notably slightly glossier than some productions due to the corporate funding by Naver.) Its slightly limited by settings and quality of camera angles and gradients in parts, but certainly not bad either. Overall  Dont Lie, Rahee truly epitomizes a  binge-watch miniseries; shortly compacted into less than twenty minute episodes and easy enough to watch in one sitting. The acting is solid enough and whilst there were a few questionable moments, the chemistry between our main leads was surprisingly dynamic.  The storyline is limited by certain elements of writing, execution and  buildup, but did offer  enough opportunities in for those willing to disengage and embark into a lighthearted and fluffy viewing session."

Cinematography, special effects and directing are excellent. This is the type of CGI that Jirisan should emulate. Acting is top notch as well. My only gripe was the plot, which was teetering on the edge of insanity. It establishes itself as sci-fi right off the bat, but becomes more and more outlandish as the episodes go on. The last episode was like watching a mashup between Inception and X-men. I would have appreciated more restraint in introducing more outlandish elements into the story. It's only 6 episodes so the pacing was tight, no time for filler episodes/scenes which is good. This drama ends with a cliffhanger, with a possibility of a season 2. I wished the story ended more conclusively but at least the main plot is more or less wrapped up. I'm iffy about season 2 honestly, because it seems like it would just become more crazy."

Dr. Mo Ian is a psychiatrist who has lost his license to practice because a patient's case was made public. That is because his office is set up in an under construction building to unofficially see patients there where anyone can eavesdrop or steal a glimpse at his patient's files. That itself is bizarre. Secondly, the is no explanation why he follows the female lead or acts like he knows her or stalks her. It just doesn't make sense. I couldn't understand if he had seen her previously or not. At times I wondered if something got lost in translation.There are a few interesting moments which involve him treating patients but they are rare. Even from a romantic genre point of view, I don't think it's worth watching. The acting is not really special. The dialogues aren't memorable which could have otherwise made up for the limited time. There was no opportunity to build up the characters which is the biggest flaw. Furthermore the story is forgettable.

TVING originals have long been held in regard by critics and viewers alike for slick cinematography and shots. However,  Dr Parks Clinic was an odd anomaly. The series shaky camera shots and editing presented the series as  surprisingly mediocre for a TVNING original;  a low-budget sitcom which whilst heartwarming in necessary parts, often struggled to truly deliver the last laugh. Adapted from former doctor Jang Bong-Soos popular  webcomic, the series revolved around Doctor Park Won Jang ( Lee Seo-jin); a seemingly third-rate doctor who has just opened his first medical clinic.  Despite constantly worrying about his recent onset of alopecia and his wife Sa Mo-Rims ( Ra Mi-Ran) overspending , Doctor Parks dreams of becoming an affluent doctor  are soon scuppered when his patient numbers begin to dwindle.  Determined to turn things around, Doctor Park decides to do his utmost to save his clinic, even if it means unintentionally making things worse along the wayPerhaps one notable thing to comment about the series is that  Dr Parks Clinic is a fairly lighthearted series for the most part. Whilst the series does delve into some darker and angst-ridden subject areas at times ( especially by the latter-half), screenwriter and director Seo Joon Bin  was able to uplift the mood of the series with regards to one of the  dramas most  questionable presences; the comic relief.  Admittedly   it isnt out of the question for a comedy series to experiment and diversify  between different formats. This can often allow a series to reiterate satire, offer angst-free respite or even play around with wry comedy.However one of the most apparent   faults with  screenwriter Joon Bins style is attempting miserably to strike  a balance between being a jovial  sitcom (fourth wall-breaking and comical  setups   ) and a more bittersweet , satirical  brand of comedy ( particularly with its jokes surrounding capitalism, brands, medical condition  and South-Korean work and social culture)  but ended  up doing both formats a disservice.Admittedly  Dr Parks Clinic did attempt to offer viewers some emotional punches- a revelation from Dr.Parks tragic past, several angst-ridden  moments  as well as a surprisingly uplifting and crisp ending along the way were specifically placed to evoke a twinge of sympathy and pity  for viewers.  Nevertheless, heartfelt moments were admittedly less impactful in the  the long-term memory of viewers who will likely forget these moments after completing the series.Lee Seo-jin (  Damo,  Yi San and  Marriage Contract) starred as main lead Park Won Jang, whilst costar Ra Mi-Ran (  The Himalayas ,  The Avengers Social Club and Black Dog  ) played Won Jangs wife and main female lead Sa Mo-Rim. Respectfully whilst both main leads performances could across as somewhat corny in parts, Ra and Lee offered solid performances throughout, with Ra Mi-Ran notably adding a surprisingly endearing  charm to her onscreen persona. The supporting cast offered decent performances. Whilst there were admittedly some strained deliverances of dialogue and acting, the supporting cast were able to offer some surprising charm during other moments in the drama. In particular, the supporting cast included Cha Chung Hwa (  Harmony,  Black and  Pawn)  as witty head nurse Choi Mi Young, Shin Eun Jung ( East of Eden,  Faith and  Navillera) starring as  angelic-faced yet acerbic- tongued  Dr. Sun Woo Soo Jin ,  Kim Kwang Gyu (  Friend,  Scent Of A Woman and  I Can Hear Your Voice) playing  mixed coffee-enthusiast , obstetrician and gynecologist Ji Min-Ji, Jung Hyung-Suk (  A Mystery Of The Cube,  The Banker and screenwriter and director  for  The Land of Seonghye)  as  director of the urology department, whilst Seo Bum Jun (  Nevertheless,  Rookie Cops) played the head nurses son and  Joo Woo Yeon as well as child actor Kim Kang Hoon (  Mr Sunshine,  When The Camellia Blooms and  Racket Boys) took on the roles as Parks two sons. Due to the short length  of the series,  Dr Parks Clinic is able to maintain a  pacy speed throughout its duration. Naturally, the expedited narrative pacing did create  a double-edged sword; fast-pacing helping to deescalate potentially tedious setups and scenarios, whilst sadly rarely giving opportunities and time to explore its odd array of  characters and potentially tour de force moments either. The cinematography of the series is notably a mixture of amateurish and surprisingly basic shots, as well as some insightful glimpses into the lives of our main characters. Whilst simplicity isnt always necessarily bad per say, it could sometimes reduce opportunities in order to explore the intuitive shots or boast slick and unobstructed editing and cutting. The OST is also notably faintly memorable for viewers; helpful for promoting emotive moments and tones, but rarely delivering an impactful presence either. Uplifting, lighthearted and melodramatic in parts,  Dr Parks Clinic is specifically what it says on the tin: a social comedy about a mediocre clinic with an array of eccentric characters being introduced onto the scene. The acting performances are decent enough but the deliverance of comic relief is admittedly variable. Perhaps the comical exchanges will generate a few laughs for audiences, whilst others may be dissatisfied by the generic setups and comical elements along the way. Overall,  Dr Parks Clinic is a decent binge-watch; watchable but lacking  a certain memorable edge also."

The rest of them were few and unfinished. The only character that was interesting, in addition, was Doctor Kim, of course, and probably the second couple, which, however, didn't have any solid time to have character development, or get ot know them. The main characters however, felt watered down. There were some scenes, but very very few, that showed a bit about their past, but they never really explained things about them, like why the girl was getting nausea in the operating room, or some more details about Woo Jin's family. The two didn't have any chemistry and the few romantic scenes that they shared did not help them at all. The characters, overall, where boring and too typical. The political drama was just okay. There were however some nice notes to this drama. There was some character development for doctor Kim and we got to see a more human side of him. The nostalgia with the familiar settings and well known characters helped with the entartainment of the drama too.Now, compared to the first season, this one was not as good. The political drama was boring as we already knew the ""bad"" guy and it was more like been there done that. The first season had more interesting characters whom we had time to get to know, which helped a lot with the romance. The characters had chemistry too, which this season was lacking.

The first ideology is embodied by Kim Sabu, who represents an idealistic style of thinking. The second ideology is portrayed by Prof. Cha Jinman, who embodies a realistic style of thinking. While some may not agree, Prof. Cha Jinman was undoubtedly one of the main characters throughout the show.In the last four episodes, we witnessed intense clashes of opinions between Kang Dongju & Cha Eunjae + Seo Woojin. Neither Kim Sabu's idealistic thinking nor Prof. Cha Jinman's realistic thinking seemed perfect to me.However, I found myself partially leaning towards Prof. Cha Jinman's realistic approach. From my perspective, he wasn't the villain that many people made him out to be (I know actor's controversial past but here I am only talking from character's perspective).I appreciated how he shed light on the challenges doctors face due to angry patients & their families. In the end, doctors are human too & they deserve respect. While he wasn't entirely right, his realistic mindset resonated with me more compared to Kim Sabu's idealistic approach.In terms of romance there wasn't much development. The main couple's romance seemed stagnant although they started living together but unfortunately, FL's family created unnecessary obstacles that hindered their progress. The second couple had a smooth relationship until an unnecessary breakup trope was introduced. Frankly, the reason for their breakup seemed quite childish to me.The cases featured in Dr. Romantic 3 were engaging & intriguing.

Specially, collapsing building case & fire at the chemical plant were the most captivating to me.Overall, I enjoyed Dr. Romantic 3 more than its predecessors because the cases in this season intrigued me the most."

Considering most of the main characters in this short series are mainly singers and dancers, I didn't expect overwhelming acting, but they did actually pretty well. A little above than just fine, I would say. The lead female, JB, Jackson, Mark and Youngjae actually made me tear up a little bit, which is something few actors and stories can do, so kudos to them. I was sincerely touched by the ending, although I didn't liked it for the same reason I didn't liked the ending of the drama special Pianist (my most recent review after this).

The soundtrack for this drama is composed of just JYPE artists songs, and I like all of them, so there's nothing to complain but nothing special about it either.

Although I don't usually re-watch stuff, I would definitely re-watch Dream Knight because it was cute. It was a little dose of a light story (even with the sad moments).

That, and the two main clone characters were the only reason I continued to watch a drama which rapidly deteriorated towards the second half, after a promising beginning. I don't know how he did it, but Yang Se Jong beautifully managed to play three roles with their distinct personalities and it was so majestic to watch. You could immediately tell which one was Sung Joon, which was Sung Hoon and Dr. Lee (and it's not because of the different hairstyles.) I could write so much on his acting skills here but I'll keep it short. Lee Sung Hoon's pain, anger, disappointment, fear and his loneliness were all palpable and moving. I felt for him right from the beginning, even when he was presented as a villain, because I could tell there was something more behind his anger and malice. Let me highlight my main problems with this drama:BLAND CHARACTERS:The other characters aside from the clones were unfortunately too bland, annoying or unlikable. I could not stand Prosecutor Choi's creepy smile (which was the only expression she had by the way) and ended up speeding past her scenes. I couldn't feel anything for Detective Jang or Soo Yeon. The actually villains were just greedy, selfish people without any other side to them. It was boring to watch other characters except the clones.GLARING PLOT HOLES:I'm always after a well-developed plot so this was very painful. There were too many questions I was left with. The sheer amount of times a character got hit by a speeding vehicle was ridiculous!Why was there a need to create two clones of Dr. Lee?Why does one clone have all of Dr. Lees memories but not the other?What exactly did Sung Hoon do to Sung Joon that he lost all of his memories? Why doesn't the latter even care about it?What the heck is wrong with prosecutor Choi? She is heartless and imo the real villain in the drama.Why didnt the researchers try to retrieve Dr. Lee's organs right after they were stolen?Why are human organs treated like candy you can just steal from one another?Why wasnt there better security at the lab (back in 92) considering it was illegal experimentation? How were they able to casually take out all the organs of a top doctor and walk out with them? No, but how is it that Dr. Lees organs did not reject the bodies of the new recipients? The ""vaccine"" seems to be some all-purpose miracle cure that can cure all kinds of cancer, tumors, ageing organs and so forth.Characters keep fake dying and returning back to life.What kind of security team (at the research lab) doesnt have guns or any other weapon?Dr. Han Yu Ra always being overseas during critical times e.g. daughters death and husbands death. Shes pretty clueless about a lot of things.Mi Rae stopped being curious about her mother at one point and doesnt seem much bothered that her mother was involved in illegal experiments on convicts or kept such huge secrets from her. Mi Rae is a reporter but has also studied medicine, and doesn't look like she's playing the part of either? I mean, are reporters usually this naive, extremely trusting and kind?The chairman is selfish and greedy, yet his surprised that his daughter is selfish too? That was messed up.Detective Deuk Cheon got shot in the gut but is already up and walking in the next episode.The last few episodes were so rushed that I feel angry Sung Hoon didn't get more time to work out his feelings. Dang.Sung Joon is totally fine in the last episode and it's not even clear whether he got the bone marrow vaccine or not? At least insert a dialogue to make it clear.In short, don't watch it if you're looking for an action thriller with a good plot.

They could have used a few more extras to represent a proper school.Story is interesting and exciting though there are some moments where I felt common sense was lacking. Like trying to retrieve a key from behind a cupboard when they could have tried to use some kind of stick to extend their reach but didn't. Moments like those felt quite frustrating. But on the positive note, some characters show growth and others show weakness which is especially important in a real crisis. No character can be strong all the time so plus points for that realistic take.The CGI is pretty good. The aliens are visually beautiful, almost flower-like. Reminded me a bit of Stranger Things. And the added aspect that they are intelligent besides not understanding much about them  is what adds to the fear-factor. It was a good touch.There is plenty of blood and gore though it is not too gruesome. And mild comedy and other light moments to balance out the series.All the episodes end on a crucial point which is the perfect recipe for a binge watch. I just dislike splitting up shows for no good reason. It makes less sense that as this series is just 4 episodes short. For this reason, I can't give it a rating higher than 9 as I don't know if I'll enjoy the ending. But taking it's flaws into consideration, I'll give it a 9."
Duty After School: Part 2,,,7853,2023.0,2023.0,4,,,,"Story of 3rd year students of Sungjin High School who started a 'real war' to fight against the attack of a mysterious creature that covered the sky. Will they be able to save the planet from doom?(Source: MyDramaList)~~ Adapted from the webtoon ""Duty After School"" (방과 후 전쟁활동) by Ha Il Kwon (하일권)","Ahn Do Kyu, Choi Moon Hee, Kim Min Chul, Kim Su Gyeom, Kwon Eun Bin, Yoon Jong Bin",TVING,"This PART 2 Should Never Have Happened  If you loved the first part, DONT WATCH THIS. You have been warned. This series suddenly made All of Us Our Dead a masterpiece.The first part was an ok mess, there were some things that can be improved if you are nitpicking but still it was a fun gory watch. Then this happened. The awaited conclusion, that sadly wasnt what it was expected to be.  There was a sudden shift in tone and genre - what was initially an apocalyptic scifi horror show became a teenage psychotic drama.Unlike some people who enjoyed it till episode 9, i was already dreading the ending from episode 7, the shift in pacing was noticeable after the action sequence at the beginning of the episode, and was constantly waiting for the action and the momsters to attack. By the end of episode 8, i already had the feeling the cute alien monsters are never coming back.I can only conclude that the studio decided it is not worth to give this series the budget for special effects but they're already shooting so they changed plan mid-way that forced them to give it a totally different ending. Dont get me wrong, these whole second part is not a bad drama - if it wasnt the conclusion of Duty After School Part 1. The problem is, this is not what i signed up for.  I was waiting for a gory end, a satisfactory conclusion. I want answers to the questions that arised from the first part, but none of that were resolved. In the finale, suddenly we are led to believe that after 2 years, a magic wand was brandished and everything is back as it used to be. Where are all these people during the war? What we get is a drama that reminds me so much of the series Happiness. There was a line in the last episode that perfectly summarizes the whole PART 2, when Chi Yeol said that a weapon was developed and ridiculously all the spheres were eliminated.  This part 2 is exactly that - a total pointless waste of time and money. Whats even worse is how they treated the actors - because everyone was quite good in it. Their characters doesnt deseeve their endings and its such a waste as this could have been a career-launching show.It is such a shame because there could be a wealth of ideas to mine from the original story that could have been used to extend the span of this series into multiple season. Avoid at all cost. Not worth your time."

Just why is this a thing?

I know that you're not supposed to write reviews for shows if you haven't completed them but honestly, I just couldn't contain my bewilderment with this one. I really truly don't understand why anyone in their right mind would watch this. (Especially a non-EXO fan) If you know the answer to that, please enlighten me.

I mean, this is just plain bad. Period. You've got to get high and lose a few brain cells in order to find this shit hilarious. Don't get me wrong, I've got no problem seeing Sehun, Chanyeol, D.O and Bacon do their thing but when you add one hell of a TSTL (too stupid to live) heroine in their midst, it just turns everything sour.

I couldn't handle Ji Yeon Hee's immaturity for a single second and her brother's cute awkwardness wasn't nearly enough to balance it out. She's cringey on a whole other level and it's not adorable in the least. Also, the way she talks with her mum is just awful. I swear the brat needs to sit the fuck down and check her priorities. Funny how, she's always being a snarky ass bish to her family but she can't utter a lone syllable in front of boys. And she's 22. Enough said.

Furthermore, let's not forget how they got Chan to play the brooding, cold, bad boy type. Like, I just can't at this moment. Chan out of all them? Chan, really? 
He's like an adorable little puppy at his worst, m8. Why, oh, why must you do this to me?

Obviously, I watched it for plain ol' fanservice and wasn't expecting a plot, good acting or a consistent storyline and fairly enough, it did indeed lack on all those fronts. But what I also didn't expect was the human embodiment of complete and total aggravation that was our female lead.

It is amazing how I even managed to stand 4 episodes of this nightmare. It truly is a fete when a show is so horrible it makes a 15 minute episode feel like an hour. I repeatedly checked how much of it was left and when I realized that I had endured so much suffering and only 5 minutes had passed, I think I decomposed a little inside.

The only good thing that came out of this was that the guys were able to make money off of it. As far as I'm concerned, I'm sorry but I'm just not strong enough to bear this kind of agony. 

I am in dire need of an efficient eyewasher and a mental detox after this. I'd try to come back after I heal and watch four more episodes to support the group but surely, recovery from this requires total mental rest for atleast more than 365 days. 

For all those people who watched and enjoyed this, I envy you. Really, kudos to you. I don't know how you did it. Fighting!

The music was great, though I do not know why it kept being referred to as rock. It is not rock! :p It is very catchy pop. Nirvana's Nevermind album was featured and I think it was supposed to be an influence, but has absolutely nothing in common with Entertainer Band's music. That was probably a peeve of mine worth mentioning. :p

The acting was decent but nothing extremely special. Ji Sung, whom I think is an amazing actor btw, was great as usual, but he has played much more interesting characters in other dramas. I was very disappointed by Hyeri's acting in this. After her performance in Reply 1988, I had high hopes. I think she was extremely under par in this. Of course it didn't help that her character was written to be naive and rather foolish. I also thought that she had absolutely zero chemistry with Ji Sung. Not because of the RL age gap either, but because she just seemed so awkward and out of place alongside him.

TV productions are full of it. Actually, the revenge-motiv appears to be eternally young, being grippingly re-staged over and over again. ""Eve"" from the year 2022 is one of them - idiosyncratic, with an unmistakable coat of paint. ""Eve"" is about a long-planned vendetta against one of the most powerful Jaebeol clans in the land. ""Eve"" may join a long list of KDramas in the revenge genre. However, this KDrama scores with its very own charismatic aura.Premise of the revenge-plan against the most powerful: Perfection should be brought down by perfection. Maximum control should be conquered by maximum control. If one wants to control life to perfection, what remains is a lifeless, loveless shell. The price of power is transcending one's humanity. The little Jaebeol preschool daughter vividly fights the emotional price of power: she's already learning to play golf, but she's still peeing her pants - shes overstrained ... Living the Win are her parents and grandparents: feeling and behaving like deities... The perfection of arrogance finds its direct expression in the control, the unscrupulous abuse and the brutal oppression of others. It goes hand in hand with self-control. Yet, the extent of the staging of their 'beauty' and perfection becomes downright repulsive and turns 'beauty' into its opposite - disgust.The (dramaturgically chosen) valve grounding the human being in his earthly transient body is the dance. Here especially the tango. Exotic, erotic, heavy, deep, dark. The dance, the rhythm and the music bring you back into your own body. You have to listen to it - in tango to the body of the partner, too. So it's also about perfection here, but it consists of perfectly balancing your own body movements with personal authenticity, feelings and perception. THIS perfection draws from itself and is not at the expense of others. It culminates in a state of relinquishment of control - an altered state of consciousness. This condition only lasts for the moment of the dance, for the moment of encounter. (The Andalusian flamenco even coined its own term for bringing the dance to perfection: 'Duende'. This concept stands for an almost ecstatic state of consciousness that results from  surrendering to the interplay of different brain areas, physical dance technique and emotion.) This moment makes you feel alive - intense, true, pure and innocent.Throughout the individual episodes the revenge-hungry protagonist (a fantastic So Yae-ji) maintains an extremely high tension between the poles of maximum possible emotional self-control (in the service of the elaborate revenge plan) on the one hand and complete surrender to the sensual, invigorating movements of tango dance on the other. As the dance draws its power and charisma from the depth of the subjective, authentic emotional world, maintaining this tension is almost impossible. In fact the KDrama thrives on this very special dynamic (of the sheer impossible bearing of the tension between self-control and surrender). The result is a consistently high and gripping intensity.I have read some reviews that accuse this KDrama of the (missing) chemistry of the protagonists or the ending or the resolution of the revenge motive, or even the revenge motive at all. Well, that is of course a matter of taste, too. In any case, I think the motive for revenge suits South Korean authoritarian society. Even today. I also consider the character of Kang Yoon Gyeom being drawn (and acted) extremely well - if the protagonist were sympathetic, open, tangible (and, if you like, more classically attractive), then the relationship dynamics would be more predictable. His repulsive, calculating side suits him. The fact that he is 40 already plus he doesn't really fit the image of classic male love interest suits the role, too. So do those very subtle nuances that reveal his other (touchable, needy) side. He is not extremely likeable. I agree. Yet, thus the provoking relationship with him subtly, unintentionally and unexpectedly develops its own dynamic. The ambivalence - attractive vs. repulsive - comes across quite well in my opinion. A strange chemical mixture, an unknown factor in the revenge plan equation. The reactions triggered by this in turn leads to an ending, that is what it is. ... Either way, revenge NEVER makes you really 'satisfied'. Because the pain of the old wounds or the memory never goes away, and the loss cannot be reversed either. On the other hand, with revenge new karma comes along and is guaranteed to be saddled on top of everything else, which one has to spoon up ... (This is usually overlooked when one sets out to take revenge...)From my perspective, ""Eve"" is a haunting KDrama - with a lasting impression for sure.It might also be worth mentioning:The staging of the cruelty within the Elite world, their madness as well as the space given for the sexual dimension of the relationship are exceptional for a KDrama. However, these deliberately staged rather animalistic or even archaic aspects of the human species (which are assigned to the evolutionarily older brainstem or reptilian brain) set a sharp contrast to the hypocritical, superhuman self-portrayal of the Jaebeol elite...---------------------- SIDE NOTE: --- Revenge motive and KDrama - for once wanting to control the elite 'authorities' who otherwise control the rest of the country ---South Korea (with its comparably recent dictatorship history) is probably one of the places on earth where (perhaps a little bit more than in many other places where rule of law has already gained a somewhat more solid footing) rules still mainly apply to 'simple' people, the masses. The influential Elite, the Jaebeol in particular, namely play their private, own, elitist game. They are isolated from the rest of society. They seem to own the world. They live and rule as they please in their own orbit. When their world collides with the masses, it's annoying, but rarely turns out bad for them. They simply get rid of disruptive factors (or better: let others get rid of them). They enjoy all the freedoms. For them, ordinary people are actually of no worth. They can be substituted. They can be controlled by money or violence.The state should actually be responsible for objective justice. But 'state' is made up of people. And the less binding the objective rules are handled by these people or the more rules can be bent, stretched and interpreted in favor of the 'perpetrators' from elite circles, the greater the subjective dissatisfaction and the stronger the desire of the 'victims' for vigilantism - the desire for revenge!However, there is a difference between the desire for revenge/subjective justice and the realistic possibility of actually getting it. For the influential powerful, a few phone calls may suffice. The common people have to be a bit more subtle and sophisticated. Vigilante justice needs to be well planned. Especially if you want revenge on a person from the orbit of the Jaebeol. It costs time and money to be able to penetrate their world at all. In most cases, sworn helpers are also necessary. After all, it is to be expected that the same applies here: a plan is there to be discarded... Not everything can be foreseen. Details have to be improvised. The space for the unexpected can only be calculated with a degree of blurriness.Against the background of authoritarian South Korean social structure, KDrama and revenge motif often and happily enter into a dramaturgically promising connection. It offers a vicarious valve for the emotions of the many victims of a corrupt system...---------------------------------------"

The boy never actually talks directly to his mother (absent father as well) but they communicate through phone messages even when they are in the same house! Sad, right?

It's hard for me to wrap my head around what I have just seen and what exactly I was supposed to get out of watching this show.The idea behind the story and the issues presented were extremely interesting, but at some point I had a feeling as if too much was happening in too quick of a pace with too much of over the top action. It moved from dark psychological school thriller to dark action flick? I felt like instead of giving us a cohesive story, the writer wanted to outdo himself by writing more extra and shocking scenes and plot lines one after the other.The biggest problem I had was the fact some characters did not feel grounded in the story. Gi Tae and Hae Gyung were the two that stood out for me the most and I failed to understand them and their motivations. The change from school bully and teen delinquent to whatever Gi Tae became at the end seems random. Hae Gyung's introduction to the plot and her obsession over the case were also questionable.On the bright side (if you can even call it that), all the characters were bad people, morally gray at best. While it was refreshing and interesting to watch a show where there are no heroes and no one to truly root for, it can also make you feel depressed and overwhelmed.Some plot lines that were introduced led nowhere and were mere devices to push the characters into a corner, hence never got a proper closure, like the whole side story of Ji Soo's father or the guy Gyuri's parents worked with, that clearly was interested in her.But then, truth to be told, the whole drama had no closure and clear cut ending. The last few scenes literally presented more new questions than answers. With that heavy of a story, leaving viewers without proper explanation may be risky. I myself feel as if my brain was just turned into pudding and any attempts to understand the ending or certain plots would lead me to more confusion and frustration.The acting was quite a masterpiece. All the lead actors aced their roles, which were not easy to pull off. To sell a story, performers often use their own experience as a reference, but with crazy stuff happening in this show, it's hard to even imagine what the characters would feel, not to mention act it out. On other technicalities, it was beautifully shot. While the pictures were gruesome at times, I still enjoyed the camera work, use of colors and shadows and the transitions between the scenes.Overall, not a drama for everyone. Gore, death, pain, suffering, abuse, mental and physical struggle - it's a perfect combination to get yourself in a depressive state or murderous mood. I took my sweet time watching this drama, not being able to watch more than one episode per day. But then binged watched the last three just to get it over with. While, in some weird way, I enjoyed the process of watching, I also feel exhausted and happy it's finally over."

But once you get beneath that, the show itself is nothing particularly special. It is a procedural law show that examines quirky cases over the course of one or two episodes in a particularly cerebral way and there is nothing new about it.To be honest, by the end of the series the shine had worn off for me. The supporting cast had fairly bland characters and the rivalry between the two law firms did not have any teeth with the result that there was very little tension created other than how Attorney Woo was going to win the case this time. The romance really didnt work for me at all and I couldnt see why those two particular characters would be together and what the connection was between them. Joon Hos explanation, in the final episode, of the nature of his feelings did fit, but to be honest I felt such a basis for a relationship was pretty off. I think a totally different type of man would have been a better fit for Young Woo, one who could connect with her intellectually rather than emotionally.One thing the show did very convincingly was to showcase the different responses to autism and illustrate effective methods of communication. It was a bit self-consciouslyworthy at times, but it definitely fulfilled its educational remit.Park Eun Bins performance was outstanding. She managed to reveal so much through her facial expressions and body movements and if nothing else it is worth watching a few episodes of the show for her performance. However, I wont be watching the sequel, there is not enough there to entice me.What my rating means: 7+ A watchable drama, but nothing exceptional.

The first one is hugely popular but the only thing I liked about it was the main male cast, a real eye candy who have gone on to forge huge careers for themselves. And I discovered the meaning of second lead syndrome there.  Pop Out Boy was a cute little web drama, better than EY.And then there is this one. The plot revolves around a young idol singer who suddenly finds herself a villain in her favourite webnovel.  She unwittingly changes the plot of the novel and becomes a main FL in a love triangle. So as you see nothing new. But here is the turning point: this drama gives a scathing portrayal and expresses a severe criticism of social media and the power that a bunch of frustrated netizens hold in their little hands. And that is refreshing. The young idol singer is used to mean comments about her on SNS and even though she usually just waits for the storm to pass without commenting, it is visibly taking a toll on her. In order to escape it, she disappears into a novel and tries using the SNs for her advantage and it backfires badly making her realize that one needs to fight it and not just let it be and pay no attention to it.Nana as the idol Yoo Jebi is perfect: innocent asn sincere and smart and realistic who suddenly gets to live her final year of high school anonymous. Gently and sweetly she brings about change in usual high school dynamics (there is ""royalty"" the F4, the four high school studs!!!And of cours a group of bullying mean girls! And the innocent punching ball! The usual high school cast of characters!)No character is aware that they are in a novel: nobody thinks it is strange that there is noone on the roads (how did they manage to film so many scenes in public empty places? It does look like a ""novel"" village setting so maybe it was a soundstage somewhere...), that characters appear and then disappear without without anyone taking notice etc.etc. the usual novel tropes! And of course there is the second lead who almost gave me a SLS but the writers managed to put that threat under control quickly. Yoon Hyun Sook who played the SML was amazing, so sweet and pretty (I'd love to see him in a bl!lol). This web drama did not have as many eye candy as EY but plotwise it was perfect. They even managed to figure out a credible solution for the main couple. The resolution of internet troll problem is unfortunately overly optimistic! I personally do not believe in good human nature. People are not like that: everything most of us do is guided by the seven deadly sins and the internet is letting us get away with things that the good upbringing and education managed to curtail and limit before.

Seriously amazing, you'd be crazy to take a pass on this drama. 

I don't know what it says about me that I am always shocked by the actual genres of dramas once I start them. You'd think after being surprised enough times that I would do some more research, or just look at the genres listed on here. But no, I just look at a poster and read a description and if it tickles my fancy, I'm in. That's what happened with this drama. I saw the placeholder they had up on Dramafever, the one with Soon Jung in the middle and Kang Ho and Joon Hee on opposite sides pulling each other's hair. Then I read the description, and thought man, this is going to be absolutely hilarious. 

I don't want to say I was wrong, because there are quite a few legitimately hilarious moments in each episode, and it does do a fairly good job of balancing levity with melodrama. But man, this drama made me cry several times. And not the dainty, one shining tear cry. The ugly kind of cry that makes your boyfriend look at you like you have finally gone insane, just as he had been expecting all these years. 

So yeah, this drama knows how to hit you right where it hurts. Which sucks if you hate sad things, but is also kind of amazing because of how well the actors pulled off this story line. I mean, Dong Wook was just this character you couldn't help but fall in love with the second you saw him. He was so upbeat and cheerful and was willing to do anything to make Soon Jung smile. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you have Kang Min Ho, a revenge-fueled egotist who would stop at nothing to take down his uncle's company, even by destroying countless people's lives. They were as opposite as can be, but shared a fate that would forever tie them together. 

Then you have Joon Hee, the second male lead of the drama. I don't want to say too much about his character, but Yoon Hyun Min was just perfect for this role. I mean, just wow. Soon Jung was probably the weakest aspect of this show for me. While I did actually like her, I feel like at times she was a little plain Jane of a character. I'd have liked at least half as much character growth for her character as we saw for the male leads. Cause boy did their characters grow and change. Jung Kyung Ho's Kang Min Ho has to be one of my favorite male characters that I've seen in a long time. After his transplant, the change in him was instantaneous. It was so adorable watching him struggle with his new feelings and emotions, and even more adorable watching him try to woo Soon Jung. 

My only complaint about this drama, and what kept it from a 10 in my book, is just how much they focused on the company. It got a little boring after a while, and extremely predictable. One side was going to cause an insane problem, and whoever the ""good guys"" were of the episode was going to find a way to fix the problem. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

Overall, this drama was just exceptional, and the romance in it was just so much fun to watch. All of the side characters really did bring so much to the show, and the Wendy/Tinkerbell side story was entertaining. If you are a fan of romance and melodrama, this show should not be missed!"
Falsify,,,2426,2017.0,2017.0,32,,,,"In modern society, journalism has lost its integrity, and journalists who focus on the facts have disappeared. However, we've seen that there are still journalists who seek the truth, and if there is at least one person who is willing to look, the truth will come out from the darkness. Here we have two journalists. One is a ""media jackal"", a journalist who will write any story, fact or fiction, in order to get views, and the other is a ""vegetative journalist"" who hasn't been able to write a single article for five years. These two journalists, with the help of a prosecutor work together in order to seek the truth.","Jeon Hye Bin, Kim Kang Hyun, Moon Sung Geun, Namkoong Min, Uhm Ji Won, Yoo  Joon Sang",SBS,"Here the heroes individually are insignificant, helpless. Together they can make a difference.  ""Falsify"" (also ""Distorted"") tells an exciting story about the business with official truth. I think this works particularly well as the KDrama offers a critical examination of the rather difficult concept of 'truth', which can be bent and manipulated depending on the eye of the viewer. Is the rule of law just a pretty farce? Rather an eloquent backdrop for the mighty who operate in the shadow? Does actually anything like justice exist? What truth are we hearing? Which one do we want to hear? Which preferably not? Is it always so good to bring the truth to light?Regarding the recently common term 'lying media', used as an accusations from all different directions, ""Falsify"" offers a burning issue. Also a bit of an 'Watergate Affair' in South Korean garb (as the underlying case resembles some real South Korean one). Sophisticated journalism and sensation-hungry tabloids, public prosecutors and lawyers as law enforcement officers, so called respectable (yet cheating)  businessmen as well as gangs are all frighteningly close together. Against this background, seldom has sich wide range of positions, attitudes and motivations been thus successfully intertwined and presented close to touch on the basis of individual fates, altogether mixed up in an exciting story. Abysses open up in view of social ideals and their illusions. And yet hope is not lost in the face of (quite deadly) superiority.This is definitely not a Marvel-like (super)hero story. Here the 'heroes' individually are insignificant, inconspicuous, fallible, and  to some extend helpless puppets in a complex mechanism that is controlled by opaque forces. However, together they can make a difference in co-creation - by bundling their potentials, throwing their prejudices overboard, getting involved with each other, learning to trust each other (despite initial contempt), and no longer reflecting on what separates them. The key is a unifying idea that is bigger than each individual (with their physical, emotional or social needs). They want to give this idea shape, body, weight and charisma with all imaginable creative means. This cross-personal idea is what gives them strength (even in the face of massive personal threats) and overcomes fear. Here it is the idea of a democratic constitutional state in which there is justice for ALL; in which ALL are equal before the law; in which every citizen can/must bear responsibility for his/her actions - the price for the freedom of responsible citizens: a minimum consensus of laws, rights and obligations that are binding and binding for everyone.This idea sounds nicer and more promising than it really is, because it usually stays with the idea that is trampled on behind the scenes. Yet, it is (real) people who fill this (abstract) idea with life. But where there are people, there are also their corruptibility, their greed, their vulnerability to blackmail and their cowardice, as well as the fitting people to unscrupulously exploit such weak points. South Korea's young democracy and long history of corruption and mighty ones operating in the shadow offers a realistic, scandal-ridden environment to process this exciting and at the same time outrageous KDrama - thus offering a wide range of gray tones, emotionally differentiated and authentic. By following various protagonists from the press and the courts, the story begins with individual threads of action that are at best loosely connected to one another, but which become entangled over the course of the story and together form a strong strand that everyone can pull on together. So a bit of patience is required from the audience, but it pays off! The differently motivated characters come to life in a tangible way, become comprehensible in good and bad and reveal a reality about the business with truth that makes you shudder. We as the audience are ourselves cleverly integrated as part of the story - as representatives of public opinion and thus as perpetrators and victims at the same time.Wow!Good job. Ambitous. Thought-provoking. P.S.:Also ideally suited for repeated series enjoyment due to the differentiated, complex story."

This was a weak revenge drama, everything was facilitated for the female lead to execute her revenge. She didn't put the effort to take revenge.

Our second leads did a good job as well, although they had a different trajectory than the main couple. There are completely different feelings for their romance. The other side characters were well played, and as always, Kim Sung Oh makes a great supporting cast member.

There are a few reasons...1) So many flashbacks...seriously.  Every episode a good portion of the episode is showing something that happened in a previous episode.  2) Too many dream sequences...Pretty much every character goes through all the possible outcomes of a situation before you actually see the real situation unfold.  It gets very annoying very quickly.3) The girlfriend of the male lead is horrible!  Not the actress, the character.  The actress does a good job or I wouldn't detest the character so much.

(There were some strange character adjustments) - Even the kinder, seemingly more reasonable elders went pretty crazy at seemingly random times.The Bad: - The whole in-law situation. (this is by far the worst thing in this drama.) - FL's cheating ex & the time wasted on his trashy new family - Sung Hoon is not a good actor now, let alone in 2016 when this has been filmed. - The secondary couples had too many minor breakups, there's been way too much push-pulling for me. - The drama had 10 bad episodes in a row, following the marriage of the main leads."

She has an adorable daughter, a gorgeous husband who cooks, cleans, gives great kisses and is a skilled craftsman. They have a pretty little house and life's pretty good. Except... that her gorgeous husband might actually be a serial killer in the past. Oops.Flower of evil keeps you on the very edge right from the start. The drama goes to great lengths to write brilliant characters and explore their personalities and relationships with each other and it succeeds for the most part.Lee Joon Gi (Do Hyun Soo) was phenomenal here. God, his acting often left me speechless. The control he has over his microexpressions is crazy. His acting is so nuanced that it captures you throughout and makes you one with his character. The way Do Hyun Soo flits from this charismatic, doting, loving husband and father to this scary sonovabitch with madness in his eyes and the potential to murder always hit me like whiplash.Do Hyun Soo is an unreliable protagonist. You're never quite sure of his motivations in the start. He is smart, cunning and manipulative and gives up major red flags. He seems incapable of emotion and you never know whether he is really able to care for anyone or not. But boy, when he comes through, he comes THROUGH. And you can't help but fall in love with him.I am really proud of Moon Chae Won (Cha Ji Won) for doing this drama. I have disliked some of her work in the past for mostly playing roles that present her as an accessory to the male lead but she really stood on her own here. Her acting was excellent as she portrayed this hard hitting, ball buster cop who is as strong as she is vulnerable. The drama did a good job with developing a myriad of characters so that all of them feel important. Cha Ji won's police squad, Hyun Soo's sister, the couple's daughter and parents and reporter Moo Jin who is a fan favourite. This drama is part crime thriller and part romance. On the murder mystery front, I don't think you guys will find anything that's all that new. Yes, the real killer is very deliciously psychotic and smart enough to give our good guys a hard time. Yes, things really frustrate you as we go forward one step to catching the true culprit and are pushed three steps back. But overall the whole investigation and the way things pan out are very kdrama-ish, equipped with predictable plot devices and definitely not unique.The highlight of the show was for sure the romance. It was just so good. There was no angst and cutesy stuff that comes with new couples. No stupidity or 'he loves me, loves me not' bullshit. They've been married for 14 years and love each other like crazy. It breaks your heart when problems out of their control time and time again stand beetween their relationship and test the trust and love they have for each other. But make no mistake, they are both each other's world and always have the other's back. It's so natural, intense, mature and believable. They have great chemistry and understanding and I loved everything about them. It was amazing for me to see the way they react, deal and feel when they come to certain realizations about each other. It made the show a treat to watch.However, I definitely have some complaints. I went into the show thinking it will absolutely wreck me. I thought there was no way it will end happily and that it will break my heart. But halfway through, you realize the show is pretty vanilla. And staying true to that, they really cushioned a lot of blows and pulled their punches in the second half.As a viewer, I was half relieved that my feelings were spared but half unsatisfied because I wasn't hit in my feels as hard as I could have been. There were also some very cheesy bits and some cliche ridiculousness in the second half as they pulled out the good ol' theatrics. A couple of things were a sob fest that I kept laughing at, instead of taking seriously 'cause of how over the top they went with their crying scenes. I'd go as far as to say that our main leads may have over acted a bit in the last couple of episodes. It was in sheer contrast with the crisply written, full of underlying tension and subtle gravity of the first half.But overall, it surely kept me invested throughout. I swooned, got teary eyed, impatient, was frustrated, excited and anxious so the feelings were definitely there, to the point that it got me replaying many scenes.There were plenty of warm moments to compliment the dark ones, steamy kisses and scenes you laugh at- sometimes because it's genuinely funny and sometimes 'cause you find some dark humor in them.The sound track was great, the pacing was smooth and the acting was excellent across the board.All in all, a must watch. So what are you waiting for? Go watch it!"

It is about the decisions we make, why we make them, and the repercussions of those decisions. This is not about your favourite actors having a blissful romantic butterfly-in-the-stomach story, this is about relationships between parents and children, supervisor and subordinate, a person's relationship with their work and officemates, between married couples, ex-couples who became friends (yes, it does happen in real-life far more frequently than society wants you to believe), how people change, how people regret things and what they learn from it.In short, LIFE.And they did well in portraying and tell the story of the different scenarios people do experience in real-life, out there in the real-world.

Every single scenario, every single decision, were true-to-life, scenarios that many people actually experienced.The poetic monologues in the beginning and ending of each episode were also deep and very appropriate.

It may turn out correct but not exactly what we expected it to be, or it may be a very bad forecast but we push and find a way to learn and fix it.Kudos as well to using the meteorological setting. Let's be honest, in every country in the world, the public always see meteorological agencies as ""wrong"", ""not doing their job right"", ""should be defunded"", we are forgetting that forecasting is forecasting and there are people working overtime, even to the point of unknowingly sacrificing their families and personal lives, just to give an accurate forecast.Hopefully, this show would have had opened the eyes of the public to the kind of work and sacrifices meteorologists go through.

Started it when it was airing... And couldn't bear to keep watching the debacle that it was.Going through the reviews, it was shocking to me how many people enjoyed it. And I can see the visual appeal, for all its faults the drama is gorgeous. I didn't search for the place the drama was shot - because everything surrounding this watching experience is downright traumatic at this point - but it really is stunning. The synopsis was also quite interesting and promising. The story was simply not what we had been expecting.First off, so many things were unrealistic. The Main Lead, for example,  is supposed to be CEO (from what I remember) and becomes a firefighter while still having the same responsibilities ? I get that Miryeong was part of his new project but that doesn't mean he has the time to have an entire other job, right ? Speaking of the Miryeong Project, it seemed only very briefly explained for the major part of the drama, when it was the main point of the story. Worse, the main character put everything on the line for it, when he didn't himself know what they were after - the discovery comes much, much later on in the story. But maybe that's just me not remembering correctly, I'll let it slide.Aside from that, throughout the entire drama, plotlines were dropped and picked up episodes later, when we have forgotten why it's important in the first place. If it is that essential to the situation, why not show it to the viewer ? Instead, it was put to the side for when there might be a use to it, it felt very unnatural to watch.Not to mention the introduction of new characters we are expected to care for in the last part of the story. Characters who were essential to the story. The main reason San Hyuk was bearing a trauma was the death of his sister. We learned that in the last episodes. Instead of being uncovered gradually, the trauma plot line was dropped for a while and came back for the last part. Does it sound terrible to you ? Because it is.Let's move on to the characters. Which, for the most part, were majorly dislikable. I don't remember being particularly impressed by the acting, but it's been a while so I won't say anything about that.I found both of the leads very prideful and pretentious. Young Jae was at times completely dismissive of other people's feelings, or traumas. San Hyuk was appallingly manipulative throughout the whole story, put his business project before anything else ; and stayed that way until maybe the very end of the drama. The whole purpose of this kind of story is to show the character's evolution, their thought process slowly shifting. We didn't get that, and it's a pity because it would have made a huge impact on the story.Doctor Park - who worked at Miryeong hospital - was despicable, continuously refused to treat his patients, was filled with jealousy towards Young Jae and treated her badly for, well, basically being there.The two likable characters would be Oh Bo Mi and Choi Chang. From what I remember their story line was cute, and it was a much needed breath of fresh air in the drama.Finally, we come to the last episodes. Where their traumas simply disappear and are never heard of again. Granted, I don't work in the medical field. I'm just, you know, an average educated citizen who knows that psychology doesn't work that way. Facing your trauma doesn't mean it will magically disappear in a day. It takes work, effort, and a lot of patience. And even in the best case scenario, you would still have traces of it. They threw logic out of the window to prioritize the rebirth idea, which can work fine for other viewers, I understand that completely, but it honestly pissed me off.I'll end with the one positive thing about the drama - aside from the seriously stunning scenery. The OST was quite nice, and I applaud the artists involved for uplifting the drama a bit. I only remember the main track if I'm being honest, but I'll just do myself a favor and presume the whole track list was fire.I understand people wanting to give it a go, and there are a lot who seem to be enjoying it so it's a matter of opinion I guess. To me it was unbearable, the same way another drama I enjoyed would be terrible to someone else. What I can recommend, though, is that you give it a try and if you feel it's not your thing, then it's okay, you can just move on to another story which will be much more compelling to you.I also applaud the co-watchers who were in as much pain as I was. Their comments were gold, and maybe the reason why I stuck with this drama."

Decent actors, interesting plot premises and genre hopping opportunities.The Show has potential, to be sure. Different ideas worked for a few episodes and then fade away. Just when you thought this is getting interesting, itd change tack. Case in point, the idea that magic acts were done by ghosts manipulating the props was cute and clever. That soon changed to talking about magic tricks rather than doing the deed. Similarly, several crimes were solved by communicating directly with the recently deceased. That is not new but the potential is there to create some engaging subplots and it did work for a while but that too petered out. The idea that the ghosts have their own set of rules was intriguing but towards the end, the ghost just behave like normal people. Probably the most disappointing aspect is the overarching Big Evil Spirit revenge plot which was so diminished by the end that it was more like little evil. The Show also suffers from tonal shifts. I get that it is a rom-com at heart but it also tried to include fantasy, sageuk, crime/corruption and other social issues. A lot of the time, the impact of these themes is diminished because the show would suddenly switch to slapstick comedy or a sweet romantic scene just after a poignant moment. It does make you wonder whats the point of the transition. Speaking of romantic scenes, the leads do have decent chemistry but the Show swings from heavy push-pull to aegyo overload in record speed. You want it to happen but you also feel that it was not very natural. The 2OTP was a done deal and they are cute together.The last couple of episodes were largely fan service. Most threads were closed with pink bows. I like the way they provided the ghosts closure and reward them justly. It was as sweet an ending as you could ask for but it got messy towards the end and added more plot holes. Some scenes are shoehorned in with scant logic. While some closures are heartfelt, others are farcical. The final demise of the Big Evil Spirit was a cop out. To be fair, it is a decent, enjoyable show but it could have been better. IMHO, it felt like the writer has good ideas and they tried some out but whether it was budget constraint or difficulties in tying the various threads together, the show decided to play it safe, watered it down and fall back onto the standard rom-com tropes in the end.  Am I being harsh on this Show? In a sense, yes, but not because I hated the Show. Quite to the contrary, I really liked the Show and the beginning hooked me straight away but I can also see where and how it changed over the course of the run and it wasn't for the better. The Show could have ended with a bang but, in the end, it was a sugar coated whimper. It is not a rewatch for me. Ill let those ghosts RIP."

The problem is watching the first episodes set my expectations high.  Kim Bum and Rain are both fantastic as Ko Seung Tak and Cha Young Min. I loved their small nuances when they are acting as one. The way they showed them during surgeries are also effective. However as lovable their characters are, theyre actions are also confusing. For example, Seung Tak was initially portrayed as a book genius and although he may buckle during actual surgeries we were led to believe he was still supposed to know whats going on, but there were scences when he was just waiting to be told what the medical conditions are and what to do with them. Also, I cant tell if Seung Tak is afraid of ghosts (more on this with spoiler alert, later).Another thing lacking is a good antagonist.  Han Seung Wong and Jang Min Ho are like your high school bullies, all talk no real bite. I cant even tell what is the real motive behind Seung Wong's action. Making him morr despicable would have been more effective, or just remove that angle completely and focus on the medical and supernatural side of the drama.I may also be expecting a lot more from the female leads. Uee, as always, is amazing although Jang Se Jin's relationship with Seung Tak is borderline creepy. Son Na Eun, on the other hand, was completely wasted and Ooh Soo Jung's exposure was almost non existent.I also have to say that their take on ghost lore, feels a little bit off. **MINOR SPOILER ALERT** All the ghosts in the series EXCEPT ONE are comatosed patients, and, they implied that these spirits banish once the host body is completely dead. So were they really ghosts or some form of astral projections? In connection to that, i dont understand why Seung Tak is scared and cant do surgeries, not even during his time in school, because for one, he has an understanding that the spirits he sees belong to people who are alive (or at least about to die) in real world. And as they implied that the ghosts banishes when they're dead, that means he cant be seeing ghosts during the cadaver surgery practicum. Also what is so special about Young Min that he is the only comatosed patient that can actually posses someone? Again, should we call them ghosts? By definition, ghosts are apparitions of dead people, so technically the professor and the other guys are in fact not yet ghosts. Or, maybe, they could have made Young Min the only comatosed ""ghost"" and let the others be ghosts from dead people to set him apart and make him a bit unique, thus the ability to posses Seung Tak. I think they should have explored and solidified that supernatural concept a little bit more and explained the mythology better to make it believable.With that said, im still giving the show a fantastic 8.5 out of 10 stars. Will i rewatch? I dont think so."

Only watch this in case you are bored out of your wits or a die-hard fan of either of the leads."

That's what I did not like about it: not the clichs but just bad writing. The talk by the teacher at the beginning of the class, though was excellent and I think we should all listen to those wise words about love and relationships and respect. But then they went down the politically correct woke university road asking about pronouns, gender etc. Nice thinking!Production obviously did not have much money and it shows: it is cold and sharp and it sounds empty.

I enjoyed all the characters, and maybe only wish that Jung Her wasn't quite so prickly with Hye Joo (in the beginning) and Dong Moon. The weakest of the main characters, for me, was the actor playing Son Jin. He was a little flat for me, but otherwise, the cast was spot on. The music was exceptional.

Forgiving most parties this easily and seeing them becoming ideal human beings with a flip of switch. They ruined many lives over the years and eventually they faced no consequences. Isn't it ironic that Seok Hyun's daughter is a piece of shit psycho despite how deep his love for her mother was? The number of cast members felt too small for a 50 episode drama. Subsequently, the story also felt limited for what it had to offer and the plot stretched too thin. A long jaded 50 episode of push and pull between the Kang's family members, they had an opportunity to build a bigger plot but not much was going on beyond the Kang's house. The entire plot line of ""marrying for revenge"" is a whole big mess I don't want to get into.  The drama had one of the weakest female leads in a revenge story. Throughout the 50 episodes all we can see is her being tossed around from everyone like a piece of trash. Even when she attempts to fight back it's weak af. A proper female lead for a revenge story is a one that gets fierce, offensive and aggressive in the second half. This drama also had ""things that were too excessive but I guess it's a melodrama"" kind of cliches: the parrot, shipping container, steel beams, 15 adults chasing 1 7-yo girl, satellite images and questionable technical stuff.

To be fair, I thought the plot was interesting in hindsight. What ticked me off in the third episode, turned out to actually be a clever twist. If you are expecting a story filled with aliens, unfortunately that won't be the case. Instead it is a journey of ordinary citizens trying to make sense of what they know/experience and how easily people can be misled by scrupulous people.I would urge viewers to not give up midway.

This was my first time seeing any of these actors. I would very much like to see the actress that played Go Ho do another rom-com. I thought she was quite good. I was also taken with the main male lead. He was quite cute at displaying his jealousy for Go Ho. And I think the chemistry between the leads was believable. I didn't care as much for the second lead, as he just didn't convey any emotion in my eyes. The other side characters, vying for Go Ho's affections are interesting and keep it fun.

Goblin has just made my favorites list. Even my husband got sucked in and loves this show. The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was amazing, the actors were perfect (Hello, Gong Yoo!), the story was heartbreakingly beautiful. 

This is the first time I've watched any of the main actors except Yoo In Na. I have now officially developed a Gong Yoo crush and understand why drama fans are enamored of him.  Gong Yoo as Kim Shin/ Goblin was mesmerizing. I could listen to his voice for days. Every scene he was in was a treat. Every emotion that his character had was palpable, and his smiles could light up the sky. 
And Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak was super cute. She had a lot of detractors and the writer got a lot of flak for making her so young. But the character and her age were perfect for this story and how it unfolded.
Lee Dong Wook as the Grim Reaper had the perfect deadpan (heh) delivery. And he may be the best male ""crier"" I've seen yet. 

The story will make you laugh and make you cry. Not only is the love story epic, but so is the bromance between Goblin and Reaper. I've found that I'm quite fond of this fantasy genre and this has been done so well. I have hardly any criticisms of this show at all because even the flaws faded into nothing noticeable for me. It's sweet, funny, romantic, sad, tragic, beautiful...

The music was perfect and perfectly lovely. I don't always pay much attention to the music, but this show utilized it so well and chose the perfect songs. So many people loved even the intro song that they made a special recording of it to make it a full length song (Round and Round, but may also be found under Never Far Away). Beautiful by Crush was the best song in my opinion, and I believe that it was the theme song for our main couple. And Stay With Me by Chanyeol and Punch was another favorite.

Rewatch value is high - if not everything, then there are many, many favorite scenes that I'll go back to and relive the feels. :)"

No. Was it innovative? No. Was it fun? HECK YEAH.I truly do not have much to say. It was a series of short (most are around 5-6 minutes long) stories presented to us without much context. The urban legends they are based on are not explained, and I myself recognized only two from episode 3 (Special Guest) and episode 6 (Dimension). Did it bother me that I was dropped into the dark and by the end of each episode I was still in the dark? Not really.I saw a lot of people commenting on the lack of the lore explanation before each episode, but most of the time there is nothing to explain. Urban Legends usually leave more questions than answers, as they are supposed to be simply entertaining and not complex masterpieces. For example, the Dimension is based on the elevator game. Follow the rules and you might end up in a different dimension. If you break any: you're dead. That's it. That's how creepy pastas and urban legends work: they have little content, no explanations and a lot of ""plot holes"" but they are fun to read (or watch, in this case).The story that stood out the most to me was Dimension. It got me excited. The choice for the music was true perfection, I was smiling the whole time (damn... this makes me sound like a psychopath when you think about the content of the show and this episode). I also appreciated how the stories were all connected and clearly took place in the same area/universe, as they referred to each other.The production value was inconsistent, that I must admit. The directing and editing itself was nice and the team did a good job with creating some interesting pictures, but at times, they tried to do more than they were capable of. The CGI was a bit painful in a few episodes. Thankfully, more often than not, they used practical effects, which saved it. Being perfectly honest with you guys, I enjoyed the bad CGI. The whole show was a fun, silly ride for me so the ""creepy CGI baby"" was just a cherry on top.Would recommend it for anyone who likes silly creepy pastas and urban legends and does not expect any complex and interesting lore. It's fun and entertaining, and even though it's supposed to be a horror, it brought me more laughter than scares."

However, 25ish episodes in and I dont agree with the synopsis shown on the shows page on mdl. This review doesnt contain spoilers per say, just want to talk about it in general.1. How do you try to steal something that was never yours? The synopsis says that FL tries to claim her stolen life back. Well, its not stolen if it was never yours. So far into the show, its shown that she was abandoned by her mom. But the life the sister is living wasnt FLs. The mom and her daughter are poor too and they seem to plot to get into a rich household by marrying the rich man. How is this supposed to the life of FLs? The second thing is, you would want the character to have a realistic nature. Considering the FL is about 34. How do you make her act like shes in high school? She believes she wasnt abandoned and is optimistic that she was separated from her mother. I mean, thats like high school orphan tendencies. How are you so desperate and happy to find clues about your said mom when she has never tried to look for her? Hello? There are police reports!2. The ML is said to be a ladies man. But he isnt. Theres not a single female in show thats chasing the ML. If he was that there would be bunch of girls fangirling over him. But there are none. Also the synopsis says that he has a wealthy grandmother. Well, just now in the recent episode they hinted that she is actually wealthy. But so far, she was just seen running one restaurant. I thought that they are trying to portray her as a modest woman who lives normally. But later I started believing that they arent really wealthy. I actually like the MLs character, hes funny and cute. 3. Take this review with a grain of salt, I am just talking about certain things that felt off to me within 25 episodes of watching. I might be wrong by the end. Overall, the show is nice. You will have some blood boiling moments. I just hope that theres some character development in the FL. She needs to be stronger not be so freaking naive and unrealistically positive at the age of 34. Like, come on!"

I really enjoyed the series because it tells us about how to live our lives to the fullest, and the meaning of families in our lives. The wisdom and advice from Mr. Geum Jung-do to his adopted son (Dr. Han Seok-Hoon) and his three daughters (Geum Doo-na, Geum Seol-hwa, and Geum Se-na) are so meaningful and heartwarming. The phrases that Grandma Yoon uses also remind me of our elders when they describe the most basic rule of good manners. Also, ""Golden Pouch"" tells a story about Signs from the Other Side. Dr. Han Seok-Hoon's deceased Mom is sending signs to his son through Seol-hwa in the form of mandu/dumplings and embroidery pouch, including initial meeting between Dr. Han and Seol-hwa in the river in Namwon (the city where Dr. Han was born and almost drown in the river when he was six year old). The Signs  from the Other Side are so vividly narrated throughout the series.There is Love Triangle or rather three sided love triangle in ""Golden Pouch"". This K-drama series is so engaging and so memorable. Firstly, there is Dr. Han Seok-hoon's past relationship with Bae Min-hee, and secondly, both Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Yoon Joon-sang fall in love with Geum Seol-hwa. All lead characters have their own motivation, hopes, values and fears. There is Bae Min-hee's ambitious motivation after Dr. Han rejects Min-hee when she wants to come back after she left Dr. Han when he loses his memory and cannot perform any surgeries due to his injury. Min-hee's ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" is so dreadful and horrifying to the end of the series.For the audience, it seems that both Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Yoon Joon-sang are ""perfect person"" for Geum Seol-hwa. Seol-hwa has feeling for Dr. Han, but Seol-hwa's adopted mom, Kim Choo-ja, wants Seol-hwa to marry a perfect and flawless man, the son of the wealthy Yoon family. I find this unique love triangle story does not drag on too long, but is engaging.  Will Seol-hwa choose the man that needs her (Dr. Han Seok-hoon) or the man that wants her (Yoon Joon-sang)? Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Miss Geum Seol-hwa have excellent on-screen chemistry, one of the best I have ever seen, it is unrivalled by any other K-drama series. We really think they have been in love for centuries in Golden Pouch. I truly believe I am watching a true story rather than fictional K-drama series. Seol-hwa is so lovely. Dr. Han is so kind and never gives up on his patients, including his  love of his life ""patient"",  Seol-Hwa. He is really serious on his work in the surgical theater. Dr. Han and Geum Seol-hwa's love is so pure and genuine.However, I find the ending of the Golden Pouch series is inconclusive and unsatisfactory. There is no wedding for Dr. Han and Ms. Geum Seol-hwa nor do the Yoon and Geum families eat dumplings at the Dumplings Shop to conclude the drama series. I would be profoundly delighted if you could produce a two-hour feature TV movie that starts with the wedding between Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Ms. Geum Seol-hwa and ends with Yoon and Geum families eating dumplings together at the Dumplings shop. I truly hope for a happy ending for both Yoon and Geum families, and for Dr. Han and Ms. Geum, a match made in heaven."

Finally a couple that was more mature and not acting silly. Then they introduced the second couple who started acting like children. Can't stand them together. Also there doesn't seem much to the story. No progress episode to episode means they have left everything for the last or last 2 episodes.To be honest,  I don't really care much for the main couple's slow burn romance either. I do like all the cast members as individuals. However, the romance is not depicted well. Only the last few episodes of their romance was decent. Another frustrating aspect was that the detective brother keeps preventing the female lead from remembering anything or doing anything. Nor does he do anything. I didn't understand why. The female detective is so underutilised.I'm glad this is only 12 episodes long but perhaps the story could have been wound up in 6 - 8. After the first 4 episodes, it would be better to just skip to episode 10. Story picks up from there and gets a bit interesting.The drama is okay for a one time watch."

They truly look like a family. Also when they did the drama parody were just hilarious.It has good character development. My favorite is Myeong-seok and SeoYul-SeongRyong relationship.It's not romance focused, but there's some hint of it. Meanwhile the bromance is everywhere.The ost is really good. It suits the drama really well.The whole drama was pretty long, kdrama usually only had 16 eps. But I guess since I'm used to watch cdramas with 30+ eps, 20 eps doesn't seem much. The story were executed really well. It kind of slowed down in the middle, but it goes exciting again.Even though i love it, i don't think I could rewatch it soon.

Sure, it has its flaws but it succeeds in packing a punch everywhere that matters.With a tightly woven plot and an excellent cast that drives the story home, GF is the definition of entertainment. It will make you laugh, cry, jump with excitement and leave you dying to know what will happen next. With a suspenseful murder mystery, shocking family secrets and brilliant character development, GF had no room for any boring moment.What I loved about the show was that no character seemed irrelevant. Every single person on screen had a part to play. Im So Hyang gracefully delivered as the badass, chaebol heiress on a mission. Mi Seok Hi was the perfect mix of vulnerability, strength and style. A true baddie after my own heart.They could have done better with the male lead as he was by far the most unimpressive aspect of the show but he did the job as the upright, honest lawyer looking for justice.The entire team of good guys: the reporter duo, the police officer, the ML's dad- all brought substance to the show. I loved the fact that our heroes weren't out of the world geniuses, they were just simple albeit smart individuals desperate to find out the truth. The primary antagonist, Miss Han, was a formidable adversary. She commanded respect in the way she did her job, no matter how dirty and ruthless it was. Bae Jong Ok gave her all to bring forward one of the most charismatic villains in kdrama history. She and her TOP team members were horrible people but they were horrible people with exceptional smarts that came with their own set of charms.And ofcourse, the MC family. All of the family members were psychotic in their own way and each left a mark. Whether they made you feel fury, sympathy, pity or hatred, they never did anything halfass. Lastly, I think it would be criminal not to mention Wan Soo, the eldest son of the MC family. Lee Kyu Han killed it by bringing forward a character so complex and yet, the one with the simplest motivations. He was a true spotlight stealer.The back and forth between the villains and the good guys kept you on the edge of the seat. The schemes and mind games made every episode intense. The best part was that all the cunning, witty ways the characters outsmarted each other were wholly believable. It wasn't a ball of hocus pocus plotholes, a confused writer pulled out of their ass, instead effort was made for things to feel mostly realistic.A lot of people didn't like the ending but it was pretty satisfying for me. Sure, a few minor things could have been more developed but they were easy to ignore.The OST was perfect and it fit our leading lady and her badass take downs so well. While there wasn't a need for romance, there was enough to satisfy all of you who are looking for it. With veteren actors in the ensemble, it's no surprise that the acting was phenomenal across the board.Honestly, I don't know what else to say.

While in pursuit of the fugitive, she witnesses an unbelievable phenomenon: the founder of the Grid - a ghost from the past - has reappeared after 24 years. But why is she abetting the fugitive? This is a thriller that pursues the mysterious truth behind what saved humanity from an apocalypse.(Source: Disney+)","Jang So Yeon, Kim Ah Joong, Kim Mu Yeol, Kim Sung Kyun, Lee Si Young, Seo Kang Joon",Disney+ Hulu,"AFTER EVERYTHING, NOTHING MADE SENSE  Talk about a convoluted plot, if you haven't seen or just planning to see it, I'd say don't. Let me start by saying that it pains me to give this a low mark. First, i am in love with Kang Joon and i almost always give his dramas a pass. Second, i am at awe that Korea tries new and high-concept dramas and are not afraid to experiment - but this experiment didn't just fall flat on its face, it broke the floor and went through so deep i cant even fathom where it went.To put it mildly, no matter how senseless the plot is, the first 7 to 8 episodes were at least interesting - i loved Kim Sae Ha and his undercover vendetta, I loved Jung Sae Byeok as a  zealous and capable police officer. However, by the time we were on the episode 9, things got muddy. The last episode is a complete jaw dropper in its absurdity that when the credits rolled you will be in disbelief.Things to note:1. A woman from the future created the grid to protect the earth from extreme solar radiation. What did they do? Of course, try to catch her like she's a suspect. Put her in a lab and poke at her just because its fun. Why? Aren't the people in the know, supposed to be thankful to her for saving the planet?2. The time travelling bit is just a hit and miss, and follows absolutely no rule at all. In episode 7 and 8 Sae Ha's journey to the timeline cannot be explained in paper but i still liked it up to that part. Their mantra is time doesn't flow, and so the sense it seems.3. Did they imply Sae Byeok was raped by Ma Nok? When and how did that happen? Was Ma Nok related to Eo Jin? How did the Ghost became related to both of them?4. The last episode is one big mess i don't even know what to make of it. If they intended to make it a cliffhanger for a possible new season then it just didn't work.  They just stacked one mess after another and expected people to be puzzled and amazed.. After slapping the faces of the few who watched this season did you really expect us to come back for more? Sorry just no.5. I also don't get the decision to make it a single episode per week and making the runtime shorter. This worked exactly against the series. As a Kdrama fan i am so used to seeing at least 2 episodes per week (or in the case of Netflix a massive dump of full season) cause that kept me hooked and lets me retain the story better. With Grid, i kind of forgot there are new episodes and frankly didn't care to watch it on time.They managed to make a series that you need to rewatch, but not for good reasons. You have to, especially the last 2 episodes because watching it for the first time is not enough to make any sense, however watching it the second time i think made it worse. If there's anyone willing to explain the ending to me, please I'll be all ears."

After finishing the series, im still left wondering why it is titled Happiness. Plot is set after the COVID pandemic and  has creepily touched into our real world nightmare - what happens if after all that we faced through this pandemic and all the medication (vaccines) we are taking take an even scarier side effect?Im just excited to see Park Hyung Sik in his first drama after his military service and he looked even dashier and manlier here. He has become an even more believable and charming leading man.  It has also been a while since Han Hyo Joo's last drama and this beautiful actress fits the role perfectly.Coming in, i thought it was a mix of Sweet Tooth and Alive. The first few episodes were engaging , however, they werent able to keep the momentum and the middle episodes felt like fillers.  I wonder if something happened during the production that made them turn around and change the focus of the story, but what started out as a heartpounding scary series turned into a melodrama.  Almost all secondary characters in the apartment are annoying and felt disposable, and I couldnt care less if any or all of them died. Also their repetitious routine of going up and down the apartment to have uneventful tenant meeting bored me and is tiring to watch. Even the main characters sometime feels like bullies and too self righteous.Im not sure if they sold the drama as a post apocalyptic drama or horror but there was just not enough horror element but instead too much of telenovela drama. I also would have wanted more screentime for the Lieutenant Lee Si Joo because aside from Yi Hyun, she felt like the only character with an untarnished motive, which in honestly, the show lacks. I think the experience would have been better if it is shown in Nelflix with a one time binge drop of just 8 episodes. The ending was also a bit anti-climatic, i was waiting for the big Zombie attack which didnt happen, at all. But also to be honest i still would have watched 16 episodes with just Hyung Sik doing nothing but being his handsome self. So again, why happiness? Was it intended to mean as a quest for happiness or was it a commentary of how all people seem to be unhappy with the situation they are in?  I am still not sure.Would i rewatch? Yes definitely. Would i reccommend? Of course."

Aside from the obvious intention of patching the episodes together to transform it into a feature length movie - Is there a standard format that requires them to squeeze the playtime like this? I love short series -  when done right.  The problem is, Korea has bombarded us with quite a few luckluster short series that are not only under developed but are totally forgetable and that is exactly what we have here. There is nothing in the series that made me want to care about the main leads.  Characters keep making questionable choices. There wasnt enough to tell us their backstory, and they didnt  develop their  love story in a way for me to care about them.The only thing i liked is the music bcause these two leads can really SING.

It was a rather impulsive watch and I have absolutely no regrets. I did a true binge-watch of it and ate it up in 3 evenings. The tragic beginning to the story and then the slowly unraveled tragic history/background really grabbed me. The drama had me wanting to know what happened next as well as wanting to uncover their pasts with all the details as quickly as possible. The drama was relatively predictable for me, but it was so fast paced and heartbreaking that I didn't care. Both MCs were likable, though they felt very young (not in a bad way). They were so full of energy, drive, and motivation. I liked the layout of the story in how they were introduced with the initial tragedy that starts the whole story, then we meet them as seniors in high school, and then the story finally takes off at full speed with them as adults. This built the story and the plot very smoothly because through this, we also met the relevant side characters who played roles in the later plot, whom were also likable and enjoyable too.I was very sad for Kang Seung Mo's character the most. I became very attached for his character, through I predicted his role from the very beginning. His story was so horrific and there's a romantic part of me that feels like his ending wasn't fair (even though, logically and realistically it was more than fair, especially if this story had occurred in real-life). I desperately wanted him to have a happy ending and live a normal, successful life. This is a personal problem I have though, not something objectively wrong with the drama. His relationship with Lee Ahn was particularly precious, especially when you learn of his past. I also think that he did romantically love Eun Ji Soo and was just pushing her away the whole time in his own way to protect her. Aside from my tragic love for Kang Seung Mo, I really adored Lee Ahn. I loved him because he wasn't your usual MC. He was kinda dumb and I don't say that to be mean. He just literally doesn't have good sense or book smarts, BUT he was kind and good natured despite his past. It was refreshing to have a MMC who wasn't overly perfect in every way. He was obviously flawed - he was impulsive, reckless, and not smart, but he learned, took criticism well, and always took things in stride. He played to his strengths, wasn't afraid to show weakness/vulnerability, and didn't develop an inferiority complex. What I'm trying to say is that he was particularly lovable. I would have liked for this drama to be a bit better balanced in tones. It was pretty well balanced with humor and tragic pasts/scary cases throughout, but it got a bit heavy and sad for me toward the end (~last 4 episodes). Honestly, I think this is more an issue with me though, not necessarily objectively with the drama - it only makes sense that the drama got sadder and darker as their tragic pasts were completely revealed toward the end, but I feel like the writers being the experts could have maintained the balance a bit better somehow...While watching He is Psychometric, it reminded me a lot of some other dramas:While You Were Sleeping (the beginning of the drama in tone and pacing and fantastical abilities)You're All Surrounded (throughout the drama somewhat in plot and tone)Pinocchio (the ending of the drama in plot and tone)What set He is Psychometric apart from these dramas was the unique fantastical abilities of psychometry and the MC, Lee Ahn. I would definitely recommend this drama, especially if you like one of the above dramas - it would definitely be worth the invested time. The OST is also enjoyable!"

(Eleanor Roosevelt)  If you are someone who can see through the facade to the merciless pen underneath, then you will love this drama. The writer, Jung Sung Joo, shares Jane Austens ability to allow characters to damn themselves through the words that emerge from their own mouths, and she reveals a feast of dangerous stupidity and ignorance, stuffed full of self importance, pompous delusion and total helplessness. The art of good satire is to clearly reveal the self interest and evil hidden behind the veil (such an apt anagram!) which the powerful draw over it. This show does that in spades. Hysterically funny at the start as it draws the lines of battle. Then it inches down the road to seriousness until, twisting the knife, the cost in suffering of the abuse of power is laid bare. However funny it is, this drama is a deeply serious comment on the use and abuse of power in a society in transition to the modern, and the underlying ruthless, self-interested principles that guide it.The skill of the writer is so much more subtle than simply mocking and attacking. The script, in the wonderful hands of director Ahn Pan Seok, simultaneously unfolds multiple perspectives on a situation. Laughter and anger share the same space. One second judgemental, the next sympathetic towards the same character. The music (by Lee Nam Yeon) is a masterpiece of counterpoint and a character in itself, as is the suffocating environment of the house. This biting satire on class and privilege may not make a great deal of sense to people from more notionally egalitarian societies without a history of aristocracy. The true aristocracy are not people who have wealth and power because they have made it on their own merit, or through business dealings or corruption, like the chaebol (who also feature in the story). Their wealth, power and status is totally unearned by them individually. They view it as their inalienable/natural birthright and that they are the custodians that must hand their power and values on, intact, to the next generation. Hence, Han Jung Hos bizarre insistence that the children study Machiavellis The Prince in scenes that made me cry with both laughter and despair. Part of the humour and satire stems from the fact that the Han family is not truly aristocratic (the father is third generation nouveau riche) but they ape the values of the aristocracy.  They do it with the clumsy, narrow-minded misunderstanding and thoroughness that only the aspiring can have, and in the process wreak  devastating havoc on everyone else. The corrupted worship of tradition and ceremony may be ridiculous, but make no mistake, the power is real and dangerous. The script plays on the blindness at the heart of the Han parents to the privilege that feeds their all consuming self interest. Having never known anything else they cannot think outside the box. In a wonderful moment in Ep 6, the father (Han Jung Ho) claims a spurious egalitarian credibility for himself by smugly announcing that everyone, whatever their status, shares the same style of office space in his law firm and adds, what does being aristocratic count for these days, were all civilians now. Their ignorance and ego offers much opportunity for manipulative, servile flattery which in writer Jung Sung Joos hands becomes a crowning work of art. Especially in the sycophantic performance of a lifetime by Kil Hae Yeon as Secretary Yang. My favourite line of hers being (in the context of imagined alopecia) Dont worry, Caesar didnt have much hair either. To which Han Jung Hos reply is, Truly, youre the only one who reads my mind.But behind the savagery of the satire lies a humanity that reveals how trapped the Han parents are in the vice-like grip of the world that they have created from their delusion of superiority and the personal price they are condemned to pay for continuing to uphold it.As with the ending of Secret Love Affair, another exceptional offering by this writer and director combination, the ending is perfect. There is no trite papering over cracks, although I could have wanted the lead up to it to be better. Whoever ordered the cutting of the number of episodes late in the day is a philistine worthy of being employed at Hansong! Having said that, my only criticism is that overall the script could have done with an editors pencil. It is expansive in the extreme, and although it mostly holds the attention, it would have been tighter and sharper commissioned for 24 episodes, rather than the 30 it ended up being. The cast and direction are legendary and walk as close as humanly possible to the edge of the cliff without falling over.As a piece of satire this is 20/10, but as a drama, it has a few pacing faults.  I cannot recommend it enough if you are someone who likes to be challenged to think when watching. It is a superb piece of drama.What my rating means: 9+  A drama I totally fell in love with and is endlessly re-watchable. It ticked all the boxes and had some serious wow factor. It would go on my personally recommended list."

She then begins doing housework as a maid, but disguises herself as an elderly woman. Through an incident, she meets a psychiatrist, Ko Yi Seok. ","Ahn So Hee, Choi Kang Hee, Chun Jung Myung, Hwang Seung Eon, Lee Jae Yoon, Lee Moon Jung",tvN,"Heart to Heart is a refreshingly unique RomCom that I didn't expect to like as much as I did. It was after completing it that I found out it is from the same director and writer who made ""Coffee Prince"", one of my favorite dramas EVER, which makes total sense. Like ""Coffee Prince"", this drama deals with mature relationships, and I love how they both show how complicated, messy, unpredictable, and unclear relationships can be. I think most of us can relate to that! So don't expect 16 episodes of attraction and awkwardness building up to a backhug, it's not that type of romance. However, there are plenty of cute moments thanks to Chun Jung Myung and Choi Kang Hee. Cha Hong Do and Ko Yi Seoks chemistry was so unexpected that my jaw literally dropped. I started watching assuming I knew how the story would go Awkward unattractive girl with issues and obnoxious rich guy with family drama so many KDramas follow this storyline, but this one deviates from whats expected. I hated their dynamic in the beginning, but by episode 4 everything completely changed! Chun Jung Myung and Choi Kang Hee were so good together that their relationship felt real, and I couldnt stop myself from watching them. I remember liking Choi Kang Hee in Protect the Boss, and some of that no nonsense attitude showed up sometimes in this drama too. I remember Chun Jung Myung from Whats up Fox, and even though that was made almost 10 years ago, he had the same unexpected sexiness mixed with cuteness which makes him a perfect KDrama romantic lead. They may not look the part of an epic kdramaland couple, but his babyface adorableness, and her uniqueness, completely won me over, and was seriously steamy. If youre still looking for eye candy, Lee Jae Yoon fills that role very well, even with the dumb hair. Im still missing his character from I Have a Lover, so I was happy to see him in something else, with a much more significant role (I will be stalking I mean watching his other dramas for sure). Hes equally charming too, which makes for an awesomely complicated love triangle which turns into an odd love pentagon at one point, but that speaks to the uniqueness of this drama.I give a definite 10 rating for the main actors, and for all of the supporting actors, except one. Yi Seoks father is bad, like really bad. So bad I have to write it in the review, even though he is barely in any scenes. So bad I had to take half a point away. I really liked Detective Yang, and thought Chairman Grandpa was great. The person who I literally thought was useless until the later episodes was So Hee. I know shes an idol, and I think she did a good job, but she was still annoying. She kept behaving in a way that I guess was supposed to be cute, and I didnt find her, or it, cute at all. She also seemed extremely childish, so it was hard for me to take her in a relationship seriously, especially not a real relationship with Detective Eye Candy. The show is written so well that even she started to grow on me, and I eventually stopped thinking of her character as useless. Thats another thing I loved about this drama. There were really no throwaway/filler moments or characters.I really do have to applaud the writer and director. I loved that each episode starts with what will happen later in the episode, which instantly won my automatic interest from the very beginning. I loved sometimes seeing things from the characters point of view. They were able to incorporate a lot of cool storytelling styles without being too gimmicky. I also loved how they approached the theme of Love, what it is, what it can endure, and with characters really being honest about how they feel (which isnt always good). I cant really say anything bad about the story, only that it switches genres, almost completely, about halfway through. Suddenly it goes from RomCom to Family Melodrama, and although it makes sense to the story, it is still a different tone than the beginning, which some viewers may not like. The family drama was not my favorite part, but it did bring depth to the characters that I liked a lot.About the music, the soundtrack is as quirky as the show. I liked some songs, and hated others, but every song matched the story well, even the ringtones!Is Heart to Heart rewatchable? Definitely! I finished the last episode and immediately started to rewatch episodes 4 & 5. I know I will watch this all again at some point, and I can even endure the less interesting parts, because they still add to the overall story.This drama definitely won my heart over completely. Whenever I thought I could predict which drama clich would be used next, I was pleasantly surprised. Its also refreshing to see unconditional love stories, where flaws arent deal breakers (Ill give just one spoiler - There is no amazing make over, which also made me happy). I definitely recommend this drama, and I recommend watching it with an open mind. You have to ignore things like therapist ethics violations, police brutality, identity fraud, and of course stalking, and just embrace the knowledge that some things are ok in Kdramaland. I also recommend waiting until episode 4 before deciding to drop it, because the first few episodes are not a good gauge for how the rest of the show will be. Its also binge-watch friendly (It took me 3 days to complete). By the end of the last episode I was completely satisfied, and inspired by love and all its possibilities."

Weve got a big item to address today. As you know, tomorrow, were filming the high school flashback scene, right? Youve all read the breakdown I trust. So the deal is, our main character, Yi Seo is supposed to be a loser and a nobody that Seon Woo would never even look at twice. Weve got to make our star, Im Na Young, look terrible! I want your ideas on how were going to do that. Fire em at me!Wardrobe: Well put glasses on her.Hair: Well put her hair in pigtails.Makeup: Acne?[producer stays silent glaring for a minute]Producer: Guys. Seriously? Were not trying to make her look even more cute than usual. She's supposed to be a LOSER. DORK. NERD. Not adorable!Wardrobe, Hair & Makeup: [blank stares]Producer: Whats our CGI budget?Production Assistant: ZeroProducer: [rubs face with both hands] Ok fine, so shell be an unbelievably adorably cute loser.Heartbeat Broadcasting Accident is a web drama that, outside the context of faceplanting on their attempt to make Im Na Young not look stunning, isnt going to break any new ground as far as novel plotlines and the character roster is nothing but stock, generic types. So its success rides entirely on how well its cast can charm the audience. Although its a mixed bag there, it has more positives than negatives.Lee Hyun Joo is the antagonist, Yu Ra, a successful live commerce host with a thing for Director Cha Seun Woo. Shes the typical selfish, shallow popular girl. Lee Hyun Joo is fine here although deviating a bit from the all-unfriendly all-the-time might have livened things up. Had she been a backstabber on top of everything else, points for that. But with a web drama, there just may not have been enough run time to fit that in.Points for Yang Hak Jin as the very creepy and terrible ex boyfriend.The weakest of the cast is undoubtedly Jung Min Gyu as Kwon Hyuk, the friend who hooks up Yi Seo with a job at the live commerce company. The character seems written like he should be somewhat sympathetic, but hes played so erratically and disdainfully by Jung Min Gyu that he is almost as much the bad guy as Yu Ra. This show though, not all that unexpectedly, is about the two leads and the romance between them. Zuho plays Cha Seon Woo, the cool former high school heartthrob thats now a director at a live commerce company and rival of Kwon Hyuk. Its not the most arduous or novel character to play, but Zuho checks all the physical attributes for a male lead and hes got credible skills as an actor. Hes given some bad dialogue and that he still is a mostly charming and charismatic character shows hes not just a pretty face and singer.Im Na Young is getting regular work but its mostly been as an ensemble piece where here shes the one with unquestioned claim in the spotlight. Yi Seo is not a huge departure from previous characters and theres certainly questions about whether theres a lot of range in Im Na Youngs toolbox as an actor. Despite that, she has no problems playing the sweet and bubbly type and thats what shes asked to do in this vehicle. Is she leading material in a big production? Cant tell based on this show but she is capable as an actor playing this type of character. So she gets to play to her strengths and the chemistry with Zuho is ok. And that makes Heartbeat Broadcasting Accident a better than average web drama. Is it groundbreaking? No.Amazing? No.Memorable? No.But it takes a simple concept and competently executes it and, for a bite-size show, is one of the 2021 better productions."

Witch-hunt revisited. Gloomy. Upsetting. Horror with no escape  ""The Netflix production ""Hellbound"" started even more successfully on the global streaming platform in November 2021 than ""Squid Game"". Dystopias (stories about gloomy visions of the future) these days obviously hit a sore spot in the global mass consciousness - the fear of what still is to come, considering that nothing will be the way it used to be.... Accordingly, ""Hellbound"" generally plays with people's fears. The characters in the story also play with people's fears - here in the face of a hell on earth that is spreading inexorably, flanked by a modern form of witch hunts and establishing a new order in which there is little room for hope and light. Because even as a reward for a righteous life, only death awaits in the end. At best, you dont have to be ashamed and getting ridiculed of it.The focus for the 'not righteous' is a heavenly or better hellish special commando, which arrives from the afterlife in the form of huge hell gorillas and stages a small earthly hellfire from human bones. No less shocking is the moment that meticulously announces the day and hour of this death in advance. Rarely have there been so many crazy, delusional people in KDrama (here namely in the realm of the sect). The number of truly honest people can be counted on one hand. And in between there is the vast majority of the terrified masses, blinded and tamed by the New Truth Society's threats sold as hope...The prospects are really daunting. Not just unearthly prophecy and execution of the death sentence for the shameful, despicable sinners. Even more actually what this scenario does to the people. There is the group of the ""arrowhead"" who, already sort of detached from any aspect humanity. Their members receive the carte blanche from the ordained sect priests to use the brute force and terror in order to carry out a multimedia-fuelled new edition of witch hunts. They are allowed to live out their wildest violent fantasies . And then there are the  would-be gentlemen (and ladies), CEOs and high priests of the New Truth Society, who submit their new 'commandments' to the people, and the VIPs who solemnly attend the celestial court processes live and in the first row... Eventually, it cant get any worse than that. ""Hellbound"" effortlessly catapulted humanity back into the deepest Middle Ages - yet in the midst of the modern, high-tech 21st century. Business with sin is very popular there. From now on it is no longer about the hope of eternal life (in the hereafter), but merely about not to unnecessarily embarrass yourself as a sinner in the face of the inevitable earthly death...For me, ""Hellbound"" is highly ambivalent. It's done great again. Ecellent actors. Exciting story. Upsetting, because maybe not so absurd in terms of social dynamics... But do you really want to/do you have to look at it? There's practically nothing positive coming out of it. Even the hopeful spark at the end remains under a hood of fear and horror and somehow doesn't really find its way back to the light... (A 2nd season is in discussion... maybe then? Or just more fear and horror from which there is no escape?)"

I love thrillers, so I thought this drama would be right up my alley, but for me ""I Remember You"" was just ok at first, and a little hard to really get into in the beginning. Much of the beginning is spent revealing backstories, and establishing characters. There are also crime mysteries to be solved, and although they were interesting, they weren't very suspenseful, because bad guys and outcomes were pretty obvious, but maybe that's because I've watched soooo many suspense thrillers. The one thing that was great from the very beginning was the chemistry between Ji An and Lee Hyun. Their awkwardly romantic moments were a big reason why I wanted to keep watching. The weird thing about I Remember You is, unlike other dramas, it started to get better with each episode. The main cast is a outstanding (the supporting cast is great too), and once the characters backstories are established, the complexity of each character is revealed. That complexity is what creates the real suspense, because it's hard to predict each character's intentions, and motives. Subtle changes in expression, false smiles, and poker faces... I don't want to accidentally give anything away, but I will say that I love the duality in certain characters. I would have never guessed that psychopaths could be so sympathetic. Also, Seo In Guk's facial expressions, in particular, sparked an instant crush. For me, the best episodes were in the second half of the series, and they kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting to know how everything would be resolved. The beauty of this drama is, instead of a simple resolution, the ending just leads to more wondering, and left me wanting more. If there's a sequel, count me in! The only thing that really bothered me about this drama was the music. The general soundtrack was fine, but some songs felt very inappropriate to the story. As intensely cute as the romantic tension is, it still seemed not right to put in a fairly upbeat love song when people are getting murdered by serial killers. Overall, I recommend this drama, especially if you like psychological dramas, or crime thrillers. The romance is great, and a big part of the story, but RomCom fans should be warned that romance is not the singular focus. I think now that I know the backstory, I would rewatch this, and the beginning would be easier to follow. I would be tempted to fast forward to later scenes (like the super tense yet kinda hilarious dinner scene). So, although I didn't give this as high a score as others, It's imperfections are easily outweighed by the outstanding parts, and this drama certainly stands out from the kdrama rest."

And, even though the reasons why she turned out to be this way were there, the drama failed to explore them properly, though her family drama was strong and supported masterfully by everyone in the cast. The romance, moreover, was slow, a bit silly at first, and was often left out, set aside so that the slice of life will be more on focus. Also, the love triangle was more enjoyable for the bromance rather than the romantic vibes.In addition, the relationship between 17-year-old Ha Ni and 37-year-old Ha Ni was more like a mother-daughter than between two people of the same person. But that can be easily overlooked, as the slice of life genre often took the lead, with some heartwarming stories added here and there to enhance the main story and older Ha Ni's character.

I enjoyed this show, for what it was.STORY:  I really enjoyed the storyline.  For anyone that has suffered loss and/or trauma, this spoke to both of those things.  Lingering feelings of guilt for choices we've made, or even events out of our control, can affect our lives and present physical and emotional scars in multiple ways.  I appreciated the friendship that developed between the leads, a relationship built on needs that each of them had.  Often, we don't realize how someone is helping us while we are going through something, it's only once we get to the other side that we can appreciate their words, their listening ears, their sympathy and their understanding.

Why was there the hoobae that liked him (she looked too much like the FL to begin with) when it seemed to be something to just fill up about 10 minutes.

At four episodes, it is the perfect satisfying length for binging. Not too short but not dragged on for too long. This is a darker teen coming of age drama, although it's much more intriguing than depressing. Think more teen ""Fight Club"" style, complete with an inner monologue throughout explaining all the motivations behind the crazy twists and turns. This is more than a story about a plan going from bad to worse to much worse. There is a suspenseful element to the story, with a touch of revenge and romance, but mainly it's a confession from a girl dealing with her past traumas in very unconventional ways. I loved that the story was so unpredictable and kept my interest throughout, and the cast was perfect. Leading the cast is Kim Hwan Hee who is brilliant as Lee So Hyun. What made So Hyun so interesting to me is that she isn't very likable, or a ""good"" person, but you kinda can't help but empathize with her. We see what fuels her choices , so even when those choices frustrated me I still sympathized with her and wanted to see her win in the end. Kim Hwan Hee brings a lot of depth to the character so you can still feel her vulnerability even when she's being cold or calculating. I also felt sadness in her smile which was something mentioned by Yoon Ho who is played so well by Kim Do Hoon. Cho Yoon Ho balances out So Hyun's more anti-social vibe with his genuine concern and caring for others. By the end of episode one I absolutely adored his character. I loved their awkward but realistic chemistry, and he showcased the kind of likability that will make him an ideal romantic lead in the future. Their odd relationship isn't exactly the main plot, so don't expect too much romance,  but it definitely fuels how everything progresses.Every member of the cast really is great! I don't want to mention too much to avoid spoilers but there are no weak links in this story. It's also a pretty small cast which gives you space to feel like you know the characters better. My favorite character by far is the Grandma! She's the real MVP!Would I watch this again? Yes! Although some of the excitement of wondering what will happen next is gone, the performances are so solid and the story evolves so well that I can definitely see myself watching this again. Once it was over, I was satisfied and didn't feel the urge to rewatch any scene in particular (except maybe one), which is the only reason my rewatch rating isn't high.The music is good too. I thought the retro and British punk vibe matched the angsty mood of the drama well. There's no memorable ballad or song (besides Girls & Boys), but I did think the music did well in setting the mood of the drama.Overall, I highly recommend this drama. It's emo, it's about trauma, it's about revenge,  it's heartbreaking but the pace and style makes it also... dare I say... fun to watch. If you are looking for cuteness and feel good escapism this is the wrong drama for you. I liked the theme of figuring out what happiness is and whether you can be happy even having to deal with painful circumstances, and I loved the resolution for that. Many will compare this with ""Extracuricular"", which is similar as far as angst and empathetic young anti-hero leads, but this is not an action thriller, it's a story of self discovery and healing told in a less conventional way. I loved that the main character's journey is messy. Some of the last episode felt a bit too easily resolved, but the story is solid throughout with no unnecessary scenes or side plots. This drama is a good example of how well that can work! It actually gives you time to binge and go out and have an actual life afterwards! Crazy, right?! I can think of a lot of dramas that I would have probably liked so much better if they were 4 episodes instead of 16. I hope they make more shorter dramas as good as this one."

Im quite conflicted about how I feel right now. Honestly speaking, the things that made me curious were not explored enough or did not happen at all. The few elements I loved were just a part of the overall messy plot that tried to include too many side characters and stories. What I enjoyed? Exploration of motherhood presented through Yu Ri, Min Jung and Eun Sook. What does it mean to be a mother? How much is a mother willing to sacrifice for her child? What makes a mother - giving birth to a child or having a bond with them? The show presented in a beautiful way the connection that moms have with their kids. That was the true heart of the show. Going against the stereotypical depictions - in this case: stepmothers. Im a sucker for fresh takes on the overused themes. We have seen enough evil stepmothers in the media, its amazing to see good examples once in a while. The few scenes of sismance and female friendship and Oh Min Jungs character. Min Jung was simply the best and most interesting part of the whole show, with real stakes and proper conflicts - both internal and external. Somehow, her journey was more heartbreaking, but also motivating and uplifting than anything the female lead presented. Lee Kyu Hyung - he is an acting monster. What a performance he delivered. I rewatched quite a few of his scenes. He aced both the subtle and the exaggerated. I am even tempted to say, this was his strongest performance I have ever seen. What I disliked or was disappointed about? My biggest issue was the dynamic between Yu Ri, Kang Hwa and Min Jung - or rather the fact they kept telling me what these characters feel for each other, but it was never really presented so I did not believe a word they said. You can tell me even a hundred times how much Kang Hwa loves Min Jung, but if you dont actually show it, I see it as a big, fat lie. For me, the emotional connections were poorly presented and explained. I might understand what the writer and director wanted to depict, but it was not actually there in the final product. Cha Yu Ri - both with how the character was written and portrayed. Is it me, or is Kim Tae Hee getting worse in acting with each new project? I did not buy the majority of her scenes. There was something really fake about her delivery. The character itself also offered little to nothing. Its the first time when I felt like the main character is nothing more, but a plot device Too many useless characters - wasted screen time. Did we need so many ghosts and their stories? No. At the end of the day, they were there to present the regret and the longing for life. Not to mention the new exorcist by the end that served exactly zero purpose. The same plot could have been told with the use of the already established characters. The production was good. Your typical mainstream kdrama. They tried to solve a lot of storytelling problems with flashbacks and compilations of scenes, and while they looked nice, they also made the plot feel more empty, as nothing was truly established. Overall, a decent watch, but not something I would recommend."

It should receive a higher rating.I mainly watched this because of Park Sung Woong and Lee Won Jong. These two have done dramas together and they meld really well. It's just something about these two that makes the dramas click. I like Woong's demeanor.  Ever since Rugal I will try to find anything he's in.I didn't too much care for Kim Bum. His facial expressions was the way he acted-disinterested. I know his character was suppose to be going through some pain but by golly, smile once in a while!!Kim Tae Hoon's character was weak. I don't even know why he was in it. He got captured and beaten so much....his end scene wasn't necessary either. I felt relief when he was no longer in the picture. He was like a unnecessary filler.It's so funny I could name all the other actors I've seen in several action dramas that played in this.  Why do Lee Kyung Young play a bad guy in every drama he's in??I loved this. It had the right amount of mystery, drama, and action scenes although I can't understand what those  Korean men be on that allows them to get cracked on the body numerous times with a pipe or a 2x4 that allows them to be able to pop back up and fight some more.

I think I tried to drop this drama 3 times, but something kept making me keep watching. It wasn't the acting, or the story, so it must have been my curiosity over how random this Makjang would get before it was finally over. The answer? Very.In the beginning, I thought I was lost because the story was so complicated, but I was actually lost because the story was so random. It revolves around the adopted daughter of a wealthy yet dysfunctional family. I won't get too into the actual storyline but considering the genre anyone watching should be prepared for a story that's way over the top. Plot points include a kidnapping, child abuse, suicide, adultery, corruption, superstition, and family secrets, and themes like classism, abandonment, jealousy,  greed, and of course revenge. I don't mind an unrealistic story, but this drama was nonsensical, and not in a fun enough way for me to at least laugh and enjoy it. I spent most of my time watching being frustrated with every single character, and it's hard to enjoy a show when you hate everyone in it. That may sound harsh, but aside from maybe 2 characters, I thought the entire cast was awful.I'll start my critiques with leading lady Lee Yoo Ri who plays Chae Rin. I think I was supposed to sympathize with her character, which I never did. She basically has two modes in this drama, [emailprotected] businesswoman, and extremely needy. I have not seen this actress as a lead in a drama before, and after this, I won't look forward to seeing her again.  She just wasn't likable to me, at all. I don't mind the main character being imperfect or even a bit of a villain, but more than anything else she just bored me. She is matched with Song Chang Eui as Eun Hyuk, who unfortunately had only one mode, 'bodyguard gone rogue'. His character barely had any facial expressions. His character was written with a lot of conflicting emotions, but he barely showed any at all. Together they had zero chemistry, so not only did their relationship feel forced, but I also couldn't get past their questionable start. I felt totally unsympathetic towards their relationship, and I wasn't buying either of their crocodile tears. So needless to say, the romance aspect of the show was a huge disappointment.The other characters are over the top to the point that they are unintentionally comical. Initially, I thought Uhm Hyun Kyung was the lead since she was the most sympathetic character (yeah, I know she's not in the picture of the show, but still... lol), but eventually, the writers turned her character into someone so ridiculous that I became annoyed whenever she was on the screen. Kim Young Min as Moon Jae Sang was another ridiculously written character. His one-note obsession halfway through the show made absolutely no sense, so he also became a nuisance on screen. The rest of the cast were either super clich or forgettable, with 2 exceptions.  Lee Won Jong as Pil Doo amused me because he always plays that kind of character so well. At least his character made sense for the entire show, although like most of the characters his actions were pretty repetitive. Then there was Yoon Da Kyung as Manager Kim, who was possibly the only character I cared about at all. I admit that sometimes I laughed at her over the top moments, but at least she was always very entertaining in her role... Something I can't say about any other character in this whole drama.Since I disliked most of the characters it's probably safe to guess that I also hated the story. Another safe guess would be that I will never watch this drama again unless someone kidnaps me and forces me to sit through it. I think the story was meant to be shocking, and full of random plot twists, but it's mostly pretty predictable, or just super haphazard... like 'random white truck of doom coming out of nowhere' haphazard. By the end they do their best to resolve the story for all of the characters, keeping things melodramatic till the very last moments, but honestly, the only satisfying ending for me would have been if an explosion took out every single character in the whole show. Ok, maybe that's too harsh? Fine, then I'd only let the Dad and Miss Kim survive. Overall, I hope I never forget how much I didn't like this drama so I don't accidentally watch it again. If this was enough to stop you from watching all 48 episodes of this hot mess of a show, you're welcome. Even with the short episode format, some of the episodes still seemed too long. For those of you who are diehard Makjang fans, maybe you'll have a much higher tolerance for this drama than I could muster up. At first, I was amused by the ridiculous acting and craziness in this drama, but 48 episodes is a long time to laugh inappropriately at people living their worst lives. If you get halfway through this drama and you think it's the best thing ever, then keep watching because it's only going to get crazier.  My guess is that a lot of people dropped this drama as I should have. Let this review be a cautionary tale for anyone who's on the fence about dropping this drama. Just read the spoilers and trust that you should be seeking something else to watch."

There is a lot to be desired in terms of writing and character development. Given the premise and genre of this show, I thought this show would get way more ratings, but maybe people are starting to grow tired of these over-the-top dramas that air out the dirty laundry of Korea's top .0001%. With the oversaturation of dramas it becomes harder to stand out, even if you manage to draw viewers in. And the first episode didn't really do a good job of making you interested, but once you get to the end of episode 4 things get a lot more interesting. The cast is okay. There seems to be more than what meets the eye when it comes to the characters, but the execution of revealing intentions could've been executed better. I really like the FL. She is seemingly perfect like those around her but she too conceals secrets that are yet to be revealed. She has a lot of likeable qualities. She is kind and empathetic towards others. She is humble. And admirably, she is trying her best to adjust as a single mother and giver her child the best support she possibly can for both their sakes. My favorite thing about her tho is that she is no pushover. She seems like she has no fight in her but if you rile her feathers her talons will surely come out. In a lot of ways she reminds me of Woo-joo's mom from Sky Castle. Overall she is just very well-written. Gong Hyun-joo is okay. Kind of annoying at times but then again that's her character. I also like Danny (he low-key fine asf) despite him being shady.{I'll post my final thoughts her once the drama concludes}UPDATE: The ending def didn't go the way I thought and things did get a little ridiculous. Bringing the FL's character back from the dead was unnecessary and imo took away from the story. I mean he faked his death for what really? The second wife's storyline could've been handled better and she started to get on my nerves, but I did like her and the FL teaming up together. I think the strongest part of the show is how their relationship evolves and come to see each other as victims who were played by the same guy. My biggest gripe with this show is that it wasn't compelling enough and I found it hard to care or really get invested in any of the characters. This one has a lot of potential but it fell short sadly. 7/10"

It was a story bogged down by a messy predictable script and two lead actors with about as much chemistry as a goldfish and a tree. Throughout the first eleven episodes, we see little no character development in either of the lead actors, and then are left with so much sudden character development in the next five that it's completely ridiculous. 

Though, had the story a fast enough pace and a more well rounded script the show wouldn't have been such a bore. Had they cut out all the needless parts and really gotten to it sooner, the later character development and the development of emotions would've made a whole life more sense, as we'd have had more time to see these changes. Instead, the ending was rushed and messy, and also somehow boring and skippable. This series was eleven episodes of utter waste, and five episodes of trying to make it all make sense. 

The one and only redeeming quality of this series, was the second lead couple. Ji Yi was smart, down to earth, and willing to work hard, and Chang Soo was fun and cute. Together they were honestly the best part of the show, I often skipped to their parts. Their chemistry was off the walls and their romance oddly believable. I would've much rather watched an entire series about them doing cute couple things and arguing than having to watch the cringe worthy romance between the main leads."

First of all I advise you to turn off the sound or make sure to be in a space where the sound of heavy breathing and moaning are ok. The drama itself is pretty much a sex ed show for a mature audience, with a lot of things that are pretty obvious for me but I know need to be heard by a lot of people. Though the shows target audience clearly is women I would say people of all sexes could gain something by watching this. As they do deal with women sexual liberation, the big O-rgasm,  and the oh so important issue of consent + the oh so important right to chose, to not be in the mood and to change ones mind mid way. This drama has a lot of potential and could have been a lot better if they worked a little bit more with the two female leads characters. The male leads here are lovely, mysterious, considerate, honest...  And dreamy in a lot of ways so I do not really have any complaints about those two guys. But While both the female leads have a lot of lovable traits they kind of fall short... and not in a women are complex human beings sort of way that I would have applauded but more in a  slightly annoying, and unnecessary added backstory... And while about 80% of the show is progressive there  are still 20% that seem to cater to some kind of hetero and monogamy traditional values of love your self first before you can love yourself type of deal... And well I guess I am not buying it. However there may be room for a second season, where they can make up for this, so I am not giving up on them yet. When it comes to the female leads I regret to say that Hani who plays a more timid role, did not fully deliver, her acting was not very convincing and neither was her character if it is due to flawed writing, directing or a bad day at work I do not know but I have seen her act a lot better in Imitation . Bae Woo Hees acting was however pretty decent. The sex scenes are oddly tasteful and well HOT a lot of fit and  muscular bodies, breasts and buts you could flip coins off of...there are a lot of lip, licking and what not... but no fat, cellulite or wrinkle in sight which also makes this fall a bit short of its progressive objective. There is a small pimple... but it does not get a close up and is covered up quickly...  So basically a lot of eye candy and material for further masturbation.  Just not so much representation... Like at all. And people it is ok to look ""ugly"" when having sex. it is the feeling that counts and not the pose. So do I recommend it, sure why not it is not perfect but it is short and has a lot of good in it, just not enough to hit the spot... ha ha"

It started out promising, but kind of petered out toward the end. I thought that the ending was confusing (regarding the time travel element) and was sort of a cop out. I did like main characters - Hyun Jae, Woo Seung, but the whole storyline was too meandering to really have a solid plot and they focused so much on the main OTP that the other characters really suffered from a lack of development. Ji Hoon, Hye Ri, Drill, and the others were all given a good intro, but there was no follow through on delivering any sort of storytelling for their characters. 

The show wasn't a total waste of time and there were cute moments and decent music, but overall I would not watch again."

She also talks like one of the guys. After Ho Goo meets Do Hee again, he becomes involved in a complicated romantic relationship and a dangerous friendship.~~ Adapted from the webtoon by Yoo Hyun Sook. ","Choi  Woo Shik, Choi Deok Moon, Im Seul Ong, Jung Won Joong, Lee Soo Kyung, Uee",tvN,"I was so pleasantly surprised by Ho Goo's Love. At first I wasn't impressed at all, and It definitely took a while for me to warm up to the characters. A naive character falling in love with a cold hearted character is a standard K Drama formula, so I couldn't imagine how this could cause so many reviewers to describe it as ""original"". Wild imaginings... frustrating misunderstandings... high school flashbacks... secret crushes... All of this has been done in so many other dramas, so why is this one special?  Well, for me, there was a moment that took me so by surprise that I just had to watch the next episode immediately. From that point on I was hooked. 

In a lot of ways this is a conventional rom-com, but the love stories themselves are definitely unconventional. Sure there is a love triangle, that turns into a rectangle, but it's a refreshing approach that got me more invested with each episode. There's also one main character, who doesn't say a word, who was the true star of this love story, at least to me.

The cast is really awesome, though I will admit that my least favorite was Uee. She did a good job, but I just didn't like her as much as the other main characters. I admit that her ""revised"" look was distracting. I can't really say anything bad about her performance, but I was only interested in seeing her on screen with Choi Woo Shik, who she did have great chemistry with. 

Choi Woo Shik, on the other hand, totally won me over. I thought he would be too silly to take seriously, at first, but he was the perfect balance of sweetness, and seriousness, to make me fall for Hoo Goo's charm. Im Seul Ong won me over too, when I swore I would hate him. Kang Cheol flips conventional arrogance on it's head, which makes him an awesome character. My favorite cast member turned out to be Lee Soo Kyung, who I was surprised to see was so much younger than the rest of the cast. She was so good as Ho Gyeong, also the only character that I liked from the very beginning, and I am looking forward to seeing much more from her. 

I should also give an honorable mention to Ho Goo's parents, who I thought were really great too! The cast, as a whole, really had great chemistry too!

Even though I loved the cast, and the love stories, I could not give the story a super high score. To me, even with all it's originality, there were a few too many clichs, and preachy moments. Though I would consider this a light drama, it does touch on some very serious topics, though only lightly. I'm sure certain topics are more serious when considering Korean culture. I wonder if any controversial moments went over my head because of cultural differences. I am sure being American is what made some of the moments feel so preachy to me.

The music? Well, it didn't really stand out to me, which makes it neither good, nor bad. 

Would I watch it again? Sure! Some of the charm will be lost, now that I know what's happening, but there are so many moments that I could watch again. Immediately after the last episode, I had the urge to flash back to my favorite scenes (I'm still laughing about one kiss reaction in particular). 

Overall, I would recommend this drama, especially to those looking for a good love story. It's also a much funnier, and lighter drama than the subject matter suggests. They don't take certain topics as far as they could have gone, but I applaud them for going there at all. I also liked the ending, and what it had to say about relationships in general. 

I say, give it a chance, and wait until at least episode 5, if you're not convinced that you will like it. It took me about that long to really get into it, and now that it's over, I really miss it.  Add me among those who consider this an underrated drama. I'm so glad I found out about it."

I watched this ever since the start week after week and it's honestly the best family drama I've watched not in terms of story (!!) .

This drama is purely warmth and love, we watch villains in this drama and some go through huge character developments along the way and change for the better. You will cry for the antagonists. You will cry for the protagonists. Chemistry between all couples and families is amazing and the cast is really the best, they all look like actual families.

I did not have such a level of mind-f**k in a long time. Half way through the show I stopped making any theories, because it was just impossible to predict and evaluate anything. The only thing I knew was - anything can happen. The events present in the show happen in 4 different timelines, and like puzzle pieces put together, slowly showcase the whole picture. Sadly, along the way some pieces have been lost, and the answers were not fully delivered, leaving me with my own interpretations and theories. The story follows quite a number of characters, with their own back stories and plot lines, that are all connected in a convoluted way. The moment you might think you start to see the whole picture, they do 180 on you, and you are back to the beginning - confused and frustrated. Without the doubt Uhm Tae Goo was the star of the show. Jo Kyung Ho was such a glooming and enigmatic presence throughout the drama, I could do nothing, but get intrigued and drawn to him. The calmness, confidence and the assured tone with which he delivered the lines made it that much more terrifying. On the other side of the events we had Choi Hyung In - emotional and  driven detective, and Jo Jung Hyun, who failed to run away from her fast and was forced to face it. With each episode we see the paths of the three characters getting closer, leading to an inevitable clash. From my perspective, the show tells the story of the different ways people deal with trauma, grief, anger and fear. Some give up, some fight till the end, some run away and some dive into a revenge fueled path. Hometown presents how turning a blind eye to suffering can lead to more pain and more victims. Facing your past, working through the pain, accepting the responsibility, regretting the mistakes and working to fix them, even if it seems too late to take any actions - its worth living even if we suffer.  The acting from the main cast was a top level of awesomeness. I felt sad and defeated thanks to Yoo Jae Myung, confused and trapped thanks to Han Ye Ris performance, and uncomfortable with, but enchanted by Kyung Hos character, thanks to Uhm Tae Goos skills. Some of the teens' performances were questionable - the characters did not feel quite real and the emotions did not reach me. Luckily, it only happened during a few scenes, and overall, all of them did a fairly good job. The production quality could not be better. The mix of horror elements perfectly elevated the thrills, blurring the lines between the reality and creations of one's mind. For a show that is not mainly a horror, it delivers the tense atmosphere in a skillful way, giving the viewers goosebumps during a number of scenes.Are there any complaints? Yes. Set up that is not explained well. Till the end, even after the credit rolls on the screen, you wont get all the answers of how and why. If we limit the story to whats possible in reality - this makes little sense. Me and many other viewers voiced how the presence of supernatural elements could elevate the show to a new level, explaining some plotlines and characters choices and skills. By the end of the last episode, I was still confused about what exactly started the whole plot - what made Jo Kyung Ho what he was, why he did what he did, when he started and what exactly was his desired outcome. I have my theories, but the point is - I dont think the show did enough in explaining what drives the villain - they fail to explain his motives properly. Confusion surrounding some plotlines, especially circumstances around Im Se Yoon and the timeline of her death. The last two episodes confused the heck out of me. I tried to sum up all the information Ive got since episode one, but it just does not work in my brain. I might have missed something, they might have made it far more convoluted than needed, or it might be both. Overall, it was an extremely intense ride. The journey was so entertaining, even with the disappointing conclusion, I cant help, but love the show. Hometown ends with a question mark rather than a full stop, but for me, sometimes its better to not give the answers than give the ones that are not satisfying."

Aside from its questionable  title  Hometown Cha Cha Cha is a remake of the  rom-com Mr. Hong (2004)  updated and directed by  Yoo Je-won, the same director  behind  dramas such as Oh My Ghostess and Tomorrow With You.  The storyline isnt  labyrinthine . Cha-Cha-Cha is a straightforward rom-com ( taken from the original movie) of  city girl moves back to the sticks and falls in love. However this boils down to the ultimate question for newcomers thinking of picking the series up;   is  Hometown Cha Cha Cha actually worth watching? Arguably the drama does a really good job at subverting certain cliches and stereotypes beyond the expectations of viewers . Whilst   the villagers are sometimes used for stock comedy , they are often more than just filler characters also. Many of them  have their own problems  which are revealed as the series progresses. For example Oh Cheon-jae (Jo Han-chul) is a cafe owner and a washed-up one hit wonder who despite often ending up as the butt end of the joke, has a more sensitive side by desperately yearning to return back to his brief glory days. There was something oddly heartfelt about each episode taking a moment away in order to focus upon side characters such as the village grandmas  who main heroine Hye Jin (Shin Min Ah ) encounters in this small seaside town. On the other hand this brings us onto one of the biggest elephants in the room surrounding our main female lead Hye Jin. Actress Shin Min Ah is decent enough here. On the other hand her onscreen persona  Hye Jin is trickier to address. Hye-Jin is the  epitome of the  carte blanche female lead; a character who has some necessary plot-driven angst, sweetness and backstory, but rarely has more definitive  depth, emotions and  realistic flaws. Adding to the issue of  Hye-Jins character arc is that whilst she does  have flaws theyre never really pointed out by director Je-Won more directly . This is because Je-Won tries too hard to present Hye-Jin as a  loveable and perfect female heroine without considering that perfection can often be flawed  . Of course our MC does have her sob story and angst-ridden moments later on in the series but these scenes  rarely enforced more powerful emotions onto viewers as there was little to make Hye-Jin grow or learn from her past mistakes  . This was case and point  when others such as  male lead and main love interest   Du Sik( Kim Seon Ho) pointed out Hye-Jins mistakes  at times as arrogant  or rude, the drama rarely gave her the chance to grow or explain herself without either  turning the blame on Du Sik for interfering, making Hye-Jin burst into tears or failing to accept her own mistakes sincerely  . The problem with Hye Jin is that her character arc runs on pure plot device steam than actual character writing- we never find out what really drives Hye Jin either through her current flaws addressed, her career and future goals ( rather than mere romance) or for the sake of plot.This  moves us onto main lead Du Sik. Similar to  costar Shin Min Ah, Kim Seon Ho was delightful as dexterous  all-round-ace Du Sik- adding his own sweet charm to a character with a surprising amount of profoundness . Hes an extrovert, incredibly talented at everything and good-natured but also shares his own personal troubles   as well. On the other hand whilst later episode scenes  relished in tackling  Du Siks past, this did feel slightly rushed than well-paced. We do see Du Siks problems build-up in early scenes and it was surprisingly refreshing to see vulnerability against a seemingly  strong character such as Du Sik. Consequently  it felt as though the drama couldve done more to have built-up dramatic tension around Du Siks past and character arc. Whilst it is used to present drama and a spanner in the works with his relationship with Hye Jin, it was evidently used to add some tension and dramatic dilemmas rather than feeling gradually built up or allowing to present the profound connection between our leads more sincerely.This of course leads us to discussing about the romantic setup between our leads which is (unsurprisingly)a rocky road. On a positive note it was heartwarming  to see their feelings blossom .  Even from the first episode the route of potential  romance between our main characters  was obvious. Bland chemistry in early episodes was ignited by more cutesy interactions as episodes progressed as well as fire added to the flames with dramatic tension keeping the ball game going between the two characters.Similar to his previous works,  Yoo Je-Won adds  his own personal touch of oozy sweetness to the overall production. Pohang City in the province of North Gyeongsang in South Korea sets the perfect location for the fictional Gongjin village. The blue horizons of clear skies and crystal waters, provided an idealistic  escape throughout  the series.Vivid cinematography accentuates scenes alongside bright lighting, whilst more slapstick comedy from the original movie is replaced by a few farce scenes in order to focus upon more meaningful scenes between its main characters. The ending offers a more bittersweet  note for viewers with an ending that was sweet but admittedly expected.  Hometown Cha Cha Cha is the epitome of a rudimentary  sweet sugary ice cream treat- cutesy fluff and with its own bittersweet edge at times, but it could easily melt under the pressure of its own plot build-up and dramatic tension. Overall it is really dependent on what youre looking for in a drama- a quick, easy and back-burner romance setup ( which youve probably seen a million times already) in order to pass the time?  Then definitely."

Let's be grateful for the perfection this drama is. No power struggle plot lines, no over the top unrealistic medical cases, no flawless doctors with such amazing skills they could be called superpowers. What weve got is a realistic representation of a hospital as a workplace with a brilliantly written set of original characters and smart comedy with depth and heart intertwined. I could not ask for more.Some might argue that the characters were too perfect, but if anything, they were perfectly written. They still had their flaws, but I wasnt slapped across the face with them. They were insecure at times, scared, and didn't know how to communicate with others. Their small struggles and mistakes they made never annoyed the viewers, because they were realistic and made sense. Rather than frustrating everyone, it made the characters extremely relatable.The acting was A+... I truly dont think we need to discuss that. With that cast you can expect outstanding performance and still be surprised with how good the end result is.Is there anything that could be considered a flaw in it?Yes and No. I think it depends on what you are expecting to see. There is no one leading plot line. Its simply the daily life of the characters. Each one of them has something going on, but except for their friendship, there isnt any big conspiracy linking them together. One could say its a slow paced drama, but with shows like that, talking about pace doesnt make much sense. Since the plot does not progress in a typical sense (from point A to point B), we cant talk about its pacing. Its for sure character driven, and I myself love it.Whats more, the cast of characters is huge and it might feel overwhelming at first - trying to remember who is who and how they are all connected. I have an advice for you: just watch. Do not try to remember and recognize every intern, student, doctor, nurse or patient. Its not necessary. You dont need to remember with great detail who said certain lines. There is no mystery to be solved, no puzzles to create a perfect picture. You can treat it as if you just started interacting with a new group of friends - as the drama progresses, you will slowly learn the names, personalities and motivations of these people. There is no need to stress yourself about being confused at first.For me this drama was perfect. Im sad that some of my ships did not sail, but it also makes sense that they did not go with the most obvious choice. A clean 10/10. I just finished it, and yet I want to rewatch it right away."

This drama has allot of good parts but also ALLOT of draggy emotional lectures that seem to be there to  show us how doctors should talk to their patients surrounded by all things that seem to be there so the audience will feel  emotional... but instead of emotional it just made me tierd sick and brought out my less pacifistic side... It is ofcourse nice to see doctors actually doing their job in a medical drama, putting the patients and their needs first but it just gets to be to much. The way it is edited  and added violins and pianos here and there is supposed to bring out the tears but just felt artificill and had the opposite affect on me.  The amount of times people in the drama say thank you or apologize would make a lethal drinking game, that not a single person could survive. What the drama does well is showing allot of types of bonds and friendships between both the patients, their families and the main cast making way for both  extremely slow paced romance, bromance, romance , finding comfort in a person in the same situation at the hospital, etc... The 5 friends are playful, fun to watch and just make you wish you where part of their band. I love that they make way for the female lead to sing even though her singing is just awful, I love the way they use rain to make beautiful emotional scenes (yes some emotional scenes where done well) , i love the food and I love the camping scenery.

Medical dramas are one of my passions in life and I've watched pretty much all of them this side of the Greenwich meridian. And I'd like to believe I've gained at least a little bit of knowledge through the years, so them doing open surgeries during this show without using any blood or fluids other than saline, people getting up and walking around after undergoing major surgery, and the fake ass organs they used were quite glaring and difficult for me to overlook. I wished they'd done more research and allocated a bigger budget for the practical effects.But the cast did a great job. Honestly, Eun Jae was a bit exhausting in her ""I don't need anyone and can do it all by my self"" attitude, but I really liked the rest of the characters, and in any case Ha Ji Won still did a fantastic job. I feel like Eun Jae was what her character in King 2 Hearts should have been. And Kang Min Hyuk! OMG was a precious little mochi ball. The kindest, sweetest most adorable fictional doctor to ever grace my screen. He deserves more roles as the main character in more romance dramas.In conclusion, it was good, but it could have been better.

It's a political and power-struggle drama that is happening in a baseball profession setting. I know nothing about baseball, but I was never, not even once, confused about the plot because of my lack of expertise. So, if the minimum interest you may have in sports is the reason you are on the fence whenever you should watch this show, rest assured, its far more than just baseball.It has one of the best varieties of different characters representing different viewpoints. The supporting cast is not just a background for the main character to shine. They all have individual stories to tell that are well incorporated into the main plot. As much as they are shaped by Baek Seung Soos decisions and actions, he himself is also affected by people around him. Its an amazing group dynamic that makes you care for every and each character.For a drama focused on the sport, it deals with a lot of different, important topics like: women in positions of power and workplace, nepotism, disability, patriotism, family versus work. All in a really natural and not in your face manner. This way you can enjoy the depth of the story without feeling lectured and patronized.The cast did an amazing job in bringing these characters to life. While Im not the biggest fan of Nam Goong Min, I loved him in the role of Baek Seung Soo and I could not picture any other actor playing it. While at the beginning Seung Soo was a bit mysterious of a character, and it was not easy to figure out his motivation, as we progress more into the story, we can discover how gentle and simply good of a person he is.I also truly enjoyed how much of a loser the main villain was. He was not this powerful, all knowing, smart and cunning mastermind. He was a power hungry man who was willing to give up his integrity to keep the social status he was able to achieve. Extremely scared, extremely cowardly, extremely desperate.It had its fair share of character development, making me, by the end of the drama, love a character that I despised at the beginning. We see a truly natural and gradual change in our main character, as he slowly opens to people and is willing to let go of his fears and struggles.Overall, I thought it would be a sure drop from me, and I gave it a chance only because I adore Park Eun Bi, and yet, I enjoyed every second of it. The strongest point of the drama is for sure the amazing cast and set of main and supporting characters. I fell for more than one character and will come back to at least rewatch some scenes from time to time."

Choi Min Hwan did a great job as the male lead, who was flawed too, but nonetheless, he and Yuna's chemistry was fun to watch on screen; when they were cute, they were REALLY cute.  The ending was very rushed, however, as lots of web dramas are, but the very last few minutes of the drama exceeded my expectations. I wish the characters had a chance to be more fleshed out and I wish the writers had time to give us more background on each character, but alas, that is the struggle of the web drama.I gave the drama an 7.5 mostly because I did walk in with such low expectations and was actually pleasantly surprised by the end result.Also, I advise you not to watch the drama HUNGRY, because all the food made my stomach growl sooooo much; the burgers looked absolutely scrumptious.

","Bae Hae Seon, IU, Jo Hyun Chul, P.O, Shin Jung Keun, Yeo Jin Goo",tvN,"I am not going to lie, I felt extremely frustrated while watching this drama. It had amazing potential, but close to nothing worked out. The beauty - amazing cinematography and styling of our main character, and the beast - the writing.There honestly  is not much to say about the characters, since the only one that had true depth was Man Wol. She was the centre of the drama and IU did an amazing job representing her development and gradual change. Chang Sung could have worked way better if it wasn't for Chung Myung. All the rest of the characters we simply did not spend enough time with, to truly care about. I must say, Sanchez was my favorite and he was the breath of fresh air. Kim Seon Bi/Choi Seo Hee/Ji Hyun Joong aka when writers do not care.Out of all their stories, only Seo Hee's had some depth to it. Kim Seon Bin's story was extremely random, there were close to no hints about his previous life so I did not even care to speculate what happened to him. Hyun Joong's past life story had the least sense. How did his sister not recognize that the guy taking care of her was not her brother. How did his family not ask any questions, why did they recognize her and not him? You could say it was a war so they did not see him for a long time, but the same would apply to the sister. Hong sisters did not care enough about those characters to spend time to truly explain and develop their stories. They had the material for a good 8 episodes of Man Wol's side and had to fill the rest with random storylines. I could not feel emotional about them all leaving at the end, because all I could think about was: None of it makes any sense.I also believe it would be better to start sending away the characters around episode 10-12, and not just have them all gone in the last 2 episodes. We could slowly see how Man Wol is realizing all the people she loves and cares about are gone and moving on to the afterlife. How the ones that stay behind struggle with the loss. We would see her being more concerned about how will Chan Sung deal in the future when she is gone. Them gradually leaving would have more impact on both the characters and the storyline.Chan Sung/Chung Myung aka the failed romanceWhile I enjoyed Chan Sung at the beginning, the moment we got more scenes with Chung Myung and the past story developed into something interesting, I could not focus on the present. Chan Sung was simply a boring character that was there only for Man Wol's story to develop and he had nothing going on for himself. When we met another male character that had a past romantic relationship with Man Wol, but also was its own character, it was easy to forget our male lead. At the end of the day I wished for more flashbacks and less present plot. And I would rather have them as friends than as romantic partners.Kim Yoo Na aka no one truly cares about anythingWhile I enjoyed Yoo Na, I do believe they should have made her a more tragic character. Yet again, there was no depth to the story. Show me how much she struggles to fit in that new house, how she misses her old friends and family and how she is tired of pretending to be someone else. All the hotel cases aka when you try too hard to please the viewersI did not truly like any of the random hotel cases, but I hated some more than others. The most random one with the humans having sex in the hotel room to have some superior child in the future. I was truly confused why this plotline was in the drama.There were too many cases, so at the end, none of them was developed or complex. They tried to fit any genre (horror, crime, romance, melo, etc.) into the drama, just to make sure all viewers can find something they may like.Disney ending aka when you are afraid to commit to the tragedyNone of the characters involved in the drama had a truly tragic ending. Which was extremely unrealistic. It could be easily fixed. Make Yoona too late to say goodbye to Hyun Joong. After Seo Hee goes to the bridge, cut to the mother registering the baby with the father's surname because of the grandparents. Make the book about Seon Bi flop. I would even like for Chung Myung to vanish because he used all his energy looking after Man Wol. The Song sisters wanted to show us how sad, tragic, and emotional the feeling of loss is, but they did not want to show the truly ugly side of it. Because of that, the ending felt bland. Overall, during the whole watch, there was literally (and I truly mean it) only one time when I thought ""wow, this is a good writing, I finally feel the playoff"" and it was with how they used the Coffee Writer Dude. They spent just enough time for us to be curious about him and wonder what will happen to him, when he will go to the afterlife.At the end, Hong Sisters had an amazing idea, about an amazing character, and no idea what to do with the rest. Trying to fit too many stories of too many characters made this drama a... mess."

House of Bluebird,,,6037,2015.0,2015.0,50,,,,"A drama that tells the story of strong bond between the members of a family even though they are not blood-related. This drama also portrays the hope of parents toward their children’s success and how difficult for fresh university graduates to get respectable and well-paid jobs.Kim Ji Wan plays a reliable young man who brims with confidence. Meanwhile, Han Eun Soo plays a young woman with a bright personality. ","Chae Soo Bin, Choi Myung Gil, Jung Jae Soon, Kyung Soo Jin, Lee Joon Hyuk, Lee Sang Yeob",KBS2,"House of Bluebird is your typical morning Korean drama which follows a near perfect role model sort of protagonist. Kim Ji Wan is good looking, smart, and has a strong sense of justice. However, as usual, he is also poor, jobless, with no proper educational background. Simply put, he is a perfect human being except for his poor status. On the other hand, Jang Hyeondo, his friend is the opposite, a not so perfect human being who comes from a rich household, and is the son of the president of a large company. The story mainly revolves around these two households and the complex and hidden past history between them.While the story is rather stereotypical, and is played out mainly for the shock factor as with most morning dramas, it is executed rather well, and this is testament to a very strong main cast. In fact, it was this main cast by which I first decided to watch this drama. Lee Joon Hyuk, probably most well known for his appearance in Stranger, plays the protagonist, and while he doesn't have much wiggle room here as he plays a rather boring, dense, yet perfect human being, he has some noteworthy highlights in the drama.Lee Sang Yeob, I only really remembered from Running Man, plays the typical spoilt rich kid, and acts as a great comedic relief in all situations. His character development throughout the story is a focus throughout, and is probably the highlight of the entire drama. His acting, while sometimes over the top, may just be a result of the role and genre he's been put in.Kyung Soo Jin, who I briefly remembered from Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo, plays the role of almost a support role, as her story barely has anything to do with the overarching plot. That said, her story, romance aside, was probably the most relatable and had the most tear jerking moments for me personally. Chae Soo Bin, who I saw on I'm not a Robot and Where Stars Land was probably my biggest reason for starting this drama. She plays the role of a very cheerful and strong sort of character, who bottles up most of her sad feelings. She is probably the biggest victim and most affected character of the plot.The best moments in my opinion were not in the main story, rather it was the cute interactions between these characters, and the funny moments unravelled as a result. Each character each has a loveable trait about them, despite how frustated I was at them as part of the overarching plot. I was especially surprised by how much I liked the character of Jeong Soo Kyung, Hyeondo's mother.The story does suffer from a lot of pacing issues, and some plot holes, but this is what I expected from a morning drama. It didn't get too complex in my opinion, and I thought it was rather well executed throughout. What it was though was a nice, relaxing watch, with some enjoyable and funny scenes stacked throughout the middle of it to keep me interested enough to finish the series.The music was great in my opinion, with some recycled one hit wonders, and a memorable main opening track (probably because I listened to it 50 times.) I found myself laughing out loud at the overexaggerated dramatical music on some scenes, but I didn't really think that was a bad thing. The OST in general is superb.All in all, this drama is probably not for someone who's expecting the next amazing concept or script. It is a generally light hearted, feel good, funny, over the top, and relaxing watch for people who need a break from the usual intense, or typical rom-com genre. Coupled with an amazing cast, I would definitely recommend this for people who want an intro to the morning drama genre."

And, as it is only five episodes, the drama did a nice job with presenting the story, although they added too many plot lines to be able to complete them all properly. For example, the drama with the father and his relationship with his son, as well as the mystery with the rice secrets were rushly concluded and felt out of the blue. The drama had an odd twist to it as well, with the whole mystery and fantasy part was not that well made, probably needed more time to get properly presented. The romance didn't have time to mature either. But the competition part it was nice and the deserts looked tasty. The performances were good too, though that daughter character was a bit overdoing her mean character.So, overall, five out of ten."

What follows is a series of catastrophic events that ends up consuming the lives of the villagers, the friends, and the families. It's the story of betrayal, friendship and revenge. It explores the greed of human and what we are capable of doing.The writing is very good. The writer managed to wrap up this good and the ending was just excellent. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect star because I still didn't know what happened to Joo-hyub. But that thing set aside, it was intelligently written.Park Ho San was brilliant throughout the four episodes. I've been his fan since Prison Playbook days and was expecting good acting from him in this mystery series. He clearly didn't disappoint me. I think he might've just won himself Best Actor in a Short Drama award at MBC Awards this year. He was bloody brilliant.The rest of the cast were good too, particularly the actor who played the role of In-Sung.BGM was awesome."

This show is about the life of a group of news reporters and how they faced the trials thrown at them.""HUSH"" started by introducing the audience to the process of getting hired in a newspaper company. Once the key characters were introduced, the story immediately tacked its first of many interconnected plots. These were no ordinary plots as it touched on the issues people face daily in work environments and in society. Stories where the audience can relate and question the ethics and morality of what they see, what they hear, and what they read.In particular, it talked about suicide. Suicide is a very serious social problem in South Korea in recent years, it produced different movements, revision of existing laws, and even new laws, to help fight against the most common reason for suicides--bullying and unfair treatment. This show beautifully handled this subject and encouraged the audience to put themselves in the shoes of other people and to question and care about the things happening around them.The stories in each episode and the main plot were deep and provoking. It was not simply an office drama in the world of news reporting, it was a life drama which touched the hearts and minds of its audience.The casting was picked well especially with veteran actors like Son Byung Ho, Yoo Sun, Kim Won Hae, Lee Seung Jun, who were what is commonly called today as ""second leads"". They portrayed their characters well which was vital to the success of the main leads played by Hwang Jung Min and Im Yoon Ah.Lim Yoon Ah, or ""Yoona"", brought all her acting skills in this drama. I can say that this was her best in all of her acting career a perfect match to her veteran male lead partner, Hwang Jung Min. From her innocent look as someone new in journalism to a matured character who earned her badges in life.This is a good series to watch and I recommend it to anyone going through trials in their work and life in general. A show which reminds us and encourages us to speak out when we see bullying and unfair treatments and practices.-------Originally posted on my blog: https://youronly.one/yuki/review-hush-2020-202140/ under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 International License."

It was exactly what it said it was, perhaps a tad bit more, but no less.  In the beginning I called Hwarang ""Pretty Boys Fighting.""  I didn't want anything too heavy or melo and I was sure Hwarang was it.  I was right.  It did what it intended which was entertain.  It was never boring or slow.  It's also more than just PBF, too. It has a fairly solid and interesting story about a faceless king trying to come into his own and a nameless peasant basically doing the same without realizing it. Each episode was well written and often times gave me a smile or laugh. The major cast did a damn fine job, especially considering 3 or 4 are idols. The supports, many of whom were veteran actors, were excellent as per usual, but somehow allowed their younger counterparts to shine. I admit I adored the scenes between Sung Dong-Il and Kim Kwang-Kyu. They were my secret faves. Well, I guess non-secret now.  I've loved Park Seo Joon since Kill Me, Heal Me. He did a fantastic job in Hwarang.  His scenes with Lee Gwang Soo and Park Hyng Sik were great.  I'd love to see him with one or both of them again. Overall, the male cast had great chemistry, even those you love to hate. There were a bunch of bromances going on. The only sore thumb was perhaps, Seo Ye-Ji, who joined the cast in later episodes.  She was stiff and very hard to like or even dislike.  She was like a weed in your yard.  You know you want to pluck it, but you don't feel like bending over. The music was good, especially the incidental aka background music.  It really set the tone and helped move things along.  I liked the lead song well enough.  The love song was a bit annoying and is played a little too often. Overall, Hwarang is thoroughly enjoyable.  It made me laugh.  It frustrated me. It gave me characters to hate.  It gave me characters to love. It made me jealous. And at one point it almost made me cry (also rare). Will Hwarang go down in the annals of time as one of the best dramas ever? No.  Will it win a bunch of awards? Doubtful.  However, I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.  Actually, I just may while at work.  Nothing like Pretty Boys Fighting to get you through the day. :D"

I don't even know where to begin with this review.  Let's see...if you drop the first four episodes and the last four episodes, then it is a pretty decent drama.  The writing is just horrible.  I can't write spoilers so I can't go into it all, but if you want to know more, then PM me.  First, the female lead character is horrible.  I can't stand her from beginning to end.  Selfless my ass.  Everything she did was selfish under the guise of selflessness and she is stupid.  The male leads in one person may sound interesting, but it is the stupidest thing I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  What was the purpose of the circus or any of those characters that add nothing to the story?  What is the purpose of the cousin or whomever he was trying to out Seo Jin?  What was the doctor's purpose?  Forget it.  I'm done.  
EDIT:  OMG...I forgot about the over used hypnosis.  Great idea, poorly executed.

Hyun Bin is great and some of the side actors are good. I don't know what happened to Han Ji Min.  Did she always act that horribly and I just didn't notice?  Sung Joon was beautifully ""bad"". 

The music was ok sometimes.

I will never ever rewatch this.

Especially the leading lady, who, more often than not, dominated her scenes and overshadowed her partner. However, she did got a bit endearing after a while. The subtle romance with the male lead was messy and probably should have been avoided, as they have better chemistry as partners rather than lovers. The theme about lawyers representing the elite was kind of refreshing, as most legal dramas tend to go for the more emotional, underdog stories. However, soon it was obvious that the cases were more about one family in particular rather than a series of cases. And it got a bit boring too.So, overall, six and a half out of ten."

Like on Youtube (https://youtu.be/8PqTYlnfxHs), they are listed as episode 1-1 and 1-2 so I kept for 2-1 and 2-2 but nothing came out. Then I checked MDL and it said completed airing. I came to the conclusion that the story was supposed to end like that. The only reason I watched this was because it was recommended to me on Youtube. The story was... questionable. I feel like it had a good idea and a good start, but then the director and screenwriter just didn't know how to continue and develop the story. With this idea, it could have been made a better webtoon but too bad it was poorly executed.As for the cast, I'm sure most the people who watched it came for The Boyz's Hyunjae.

Choi Yeon Soo and Byun Sung Tae also both participated in their respected produce 101 series. As expected, the visuals were awesome.

It made me feel for the characters and it was painfully relatable.It may not be another ""My Liberation Notes, ""Lost"" or  ""My Mister"" but in a way the characters and their way of living reminds me of these dramas.A (grand)father that worked hard all his life, his middle aged son that never really achieved anything and refused to grow up in many ways and his teenage daughter that is quietly suffering as she lacks the support of her father and her growing resentment against the world.This drama also has some really, really good guest roles & supporting characters whose story will touch your heart.This drama isnt for people who like lighthearted comedy, as the comedy part is mostly portrayed by the things that happen to ML & his journey as a (mostly failing) webtoon artist and some of his neighbors but other than that I would categorize it as a slice-of-life drama.Its also not for people who like morally perfect characters.The ML was selfish and not an attentive father. He was human, as raw as it gets.This drama didnt sugar coat characters or situations in order for them to be more likable for the viewer but thats exactly what I appreciated. I found it to be refreshing. People are not perfect, people hurt other people.That is life. But they still love each other in their own way. I could write an entire essay on the complex father/daughter relationship and how it affected Sang Ah (the daughter).But the comedy wont leave you hanging and there is healing as well as growth.Oh and the first few episodes might not seem too promising but it really does get better & deeper as you get to know the characters more. The second half was my favorite.This drama positively surprised me and I suggest you give it a try if youre looking for a deeper slice-of-life with observational comedy but mostly very ordinary people who are struggling and whose life is anything but flashy.*Bonus:Kim Do Wan was an absolute scene stealer.

And Rom+/-Com. And more. Fabulous.  Truths just want to come out. Thus, sometimes they find quite miraculous ways.""I Have a Lover"" features Makjang. However, the KDrama also and above all offers an unusual love story over 50 episodes. It also tells about the creeping drama of marriage after the 'point of no return', when secrets and/or feelings of guilt, disappointment and reproaches have long barricaded the couple's way to each other and marriage has become a stale shell or facade, with hardly any space for dear affection left. Eventually, with all those hidden emotions it becomes increasingly difficult to lovingly respond to each other. At last, it may seem impossible to pave a new way towards renewed trust, closeness and genuine intimacy. Moreover, ""I Have a Lover"" tells about the trauma that couples as parents suffer from the loss of their child. This KDrama is about painful emotions not being shared, getting in the way of a trusting, loving, intimate relationship. In the most desperate moments the one you need the most seems the furthest away. Missing a comforting connection makes it even worse. Finally, the insincerity leads towards sadness, anger or even indifference and detachment regarding the hollow relationship.Drawing human characters with their shadows and radiance, the KDrama tells of the whole range of emotions people have and share in intimate relationships. ""I Have a Lover"" portrays an extraordinary character development process. Will the couple thus be able to reconnect?The side plots add to the sophisticatedly composed symphony of complex, conflicting emotional worlds. It's about pain and hope, disappointment and forgiveness, sincere love and betrayal, above all about romantic love, but beyond that about love in all possible facets. Family in its ambivalence as bonding and bondage, as an ambiguous place of trust and obligation, forms a creeping leitmotif that holds all the narrative strings together.The scenarios effortlessly switch between different living environments. The focus is also on lawyers - those 'footmen' serving the elite big corporations and those 'upright' serving the little folks.At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to follow an exhausting relationship between estranged spouses for 50 episodes. But it quickly became apparent that the story and its two perfectly harmonizing leads invite you to depart on a wonderfully refined emotional trek through the human emotional worlds. ""I Have a Lover"" is touching, moving, stirring, rousing, exciting. It is Makjang, yes. It is Rom+/-Com, and more. Fabulous.Ps:The KDrama (despite the 50 episodes) suits for a rewatch, as many aspects and details might then become even more meaningful..."

This is why the envelop of forgiveness was aggressively pushed beyond its limits. This is also why the drama had a very very long 12 episodes epilogue just to stress on that one single point. This is also why you may see the influx of positive comments. This is also why feelings in general became disingenuous at the end.Both main leads had a weak performance and even a weaker written character especially the female lead.

Cotton Candy only needs a one time hit to save their group, but it's not as easy as it sounds. Everything is going wrong for Cotton Candy, but the members can't let go of their friendship and dreams.(Source: Soompi, AsianWiki, MyDramaList) ","Ahn Hee Yeon, Ahn Sol Bin, EXY, Han So Eun, I.L, Kwak Shi Yang",iQiyi jTBC,"Countless misfortunes with Disney solutions.   Idol: The Coup opens with quite refreshing, more accurate depiction of idols and the Korean music industry as a whole, but ends on an over the top, makjang note. And yet, I truly loved the show. Somehow, it convinced me to ignore all the flaws and only focus on the true entertainment and emotional connection I have made with the characters. And for that, I am thankful. The drama tells the story of Cotton Candy, who are deemed as ""'( ) (mangdol - failed idol). Both the company and the members themselves gave up on trying to succeed, with Jenna, the driven leader, being the last person who still tries her best to make the team overcome the issues and survive in the industry. Each member has her own traumas, hardships and obstacles they need to face, and as the drama progresses they learn how to trust each other again, how to work as a team, protect and support each other. Idol: The Coup truly takes the viewers on a whole journey of hate to love. At first, you might despise the majority of the characters, just to end up loving them and rooting for them by the end of the show. Its also the first drama with an idol driven plot, where the songs are truly good, and something I could see in a music show. Both, the songs that are suppose to be part of the fictional groups discographies, and the songs that were only used as a soundtrack easily found a place on my playlist, with few favorites being: Home, Honest, You Can Cry, Fly Up, Pray and Remember Me.It would be a crime to write this review and not mention the amazing chemistry between Jenna and Jae Hyuk. This dynamic was extremely entertaining to watch. While at first it might seem that Jae Hyuk holds all the power, each disagreement they had, leaves the viewer thinking he was the one who lost and was more affected by it. It became a battle of wits and determination, over one character just abusing another. The acting was not outstanding, with some idols struggling to connect to the emotions and truly deliver the lines in a natural manner (Im looking at you Kim Min Kyu and EXY), but overall, none of the performances were truly cringeworthy, and the few miss-deliveries became a charm of the show too. Maybe I am biased, maybe I just convinced myself to love even the bad aspects of the drama, but at the end of the day, does it matter? It was a fun watch, whenever it had or had not had any issues. That said, If you want to watch idol romance, this aint that. While the female and male leads have amazing chemistry, and many viewers wished to see some kind of feelings spark between them, it never crosses the line of hints and future possibilities. If you want to see a realistic portrayal of idols life, this aint that. While the first 3-4 episodes did a good job showcasing the struggles failed idols might face and the industry trend to see the idols as replaceable assets and not human beings, at some point, the amount of tragedies happening to Cotton Candy reached a ridiculous number. The solutions were coming out of nowhere, just as the problems were showing up with little explanations, and at times, as complete contradictions to what already was established in the drama. That said, the issues themselves were not unrealistic, but rather the fact they all happened to this one group in such a short period of time. If you want a wholesome drama with nice characters you can root for from the beginning till the end, this aint that. There were moments when I wanted the group to disband, there were moments when I totally understood why they were failed idols and maybe they should not work as a team. I went from let them disband, through Im an ot4 stan, to I dont care if it will make no sense, these babies need a happy ending. The characters are truly flawed, but you might end up loving them despite their shortcomings. Overall, what a ride it was. Idol: The Coup has countless flaws, and yet it made so many viewers enjoy it and get excited for more episodes. The idea of one hour and thirty minutes long episodes scared me, but when they went down to just one hour, I was truly disappointed. Each episode made me want to see more, and wish for just a few more minutes of the content. I got addicted to this soft idol makjang with fun, but frustrating characters, over the top tragedies and Disney solutions."

Or is it too late to change his destiny?","Choi Soo Young, Ji Chang Wook, Kil Hae Yeon, Sung Dong Il, Won Ji An, Yang Hee Kyung","KBS2, ViuTV","When the mystery (almost) ruins the show.  Im just frustrated, because the good parts were really good, but the bad parts made it close to impossible for me to enjoy them. What seemed like a bitter-sweet slice of life, that will move you to tears and make you appreciate the small things in your life, changed into a ridiculous no brain mystery about a character no one truly cared about and mobs. There was truly no reason to give them so much attention, and I highly doubt anyone would complain much, if they were used just as backstory devices and nothing more. You know when a heartwarming slice of life shows work? When they are relatable. When the stories told in them hit close to home, since you either experience these things yourself, or you know someone who experienced them.  Its meaningful, because its a daily life we all have to deal with at some point. So why ruin the best aspect of slice of life, by adding borderline makjang plot lines and then focusing the majority of screen time on them as the drama gets closer to the end? You can probably feel my frustration, but its because I truly adored a lot of the elements of this show, just for my joy to be cut short by things that were not even necessary. Everything that was related to the Genie team? Amazing. I loved Gyeo Re and how raw the character was. The complexity of the emotions presented - perfection. Ji Chang Wook made a good choice picking this role and its nice to see him back on track with some more challenging projects. He managed to show vulnerability, but also emotional strength. The gradual development of the character was impeccable. Not to mention how his story clearly shows men can be victims of abuse too, and psychological abuse is as much of an important issue as physical abuse.While I was not amazed with the writing of Seo Yeon Joo, Choi Soo Young did a great job with the role. The character was just slightly too perfect for me. The impulsivity at the beginning was gone after maybe 2 episodes, and from that point, it was close to impossible to find any real flaw in her. Sung Dong Il is Sung Dong Il - he always delivers. Kang Tae Shik won my heart. Must say though, I liked his (sadly limited) interactions with Ha Joon Kyung the most. She was also one of my favorite characters - such a troubled person with so much pain. I wish the writers gave her a little bit more screen time, so we could truly dive deeper into who she was. That said, she might be a character many people fail to sympathize with. Girl had issues and she created a lot of issues for other characters. The compliments go to the whole Genie cast - all actors did an amazing job, and the characters felt like real people. Most of them got enough screen time to make them an important part of the team and the plot, and flesh them out a bit. The stories of the patients and their last wishes were tears-inducing and I welcomed the pain, but also the warm feeling they brought. Some I enjoyed more than the others, but all had meaningful messages and presented cohesive stories that many could relate to. And then we have two side plots that I could truly not stand - the mystery of room 403, and the mob/mafia. When I started the show, I did not exactly sign up for soft makjang plot lines, but thats what was delivered. Compared to the rest of the stories told in the drama, these two just felt cheap. Technically it wasnt a massive part of the plot, but I found these scenes unnecessary, and that influenced how the whole episodes affected me emotionally (or rather did not, since I could not shake off the frustration caused by these two plotlines). Still, the drama offers more good than bad. The production value was top notch - screenshotable for sure. Soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, fitted the scenes and overall atmosphere of the show. The songs I personally enjoyed the most were: I Can't Forget You by Kim Feel; I'll Protect You by Choi Yu Ree.Overall, If You Wish Upon Me is similar to a protagonist from any well written drama - great spirit, depth, complexity that makes you emotionally invested in them, but also having a major flaw needing a major character development. Sadly, dramas dont get character developments so the flaws stay as part of it forever. Bonus: I want a short 2nd season with Lee Yoo Mi. She can deliver anything. Just dont add mobs please ;)"

Hay una frase que Jong Goo (Jeong Hoon) dice: "" Te juro por Dios, por Buda, por Al y por mis padres que deseo estar contigo."". esta frase nos da la clave de que el amor es universal y el sentimiento de luto es universal e inherente a todas las culturas, no importa la religin (por eso meciona el nombre de Dios en las tres grandes religiones del mundo).

This is probably  THE fluffiest serial killer investigation drama out there by far, and in someways that bothers me others not ( I am not going to get in to detail)  but I find myself conflicted over the overall fluffiness in this female centered plot...

I love the friendships here (some more destructive than others), the gay couple, the little robots, it is just all so cute! Did I mention this drama is cute?

There is also an over use of slomo and I  some theater like scenes seemed out of place at times.  There where also some parts where it is hard to follow where they are (time wise) so if you want everything to make sense and be realistic this is not the right drama for you I found it ok, and I am sure as many as hate it probably love it.

The comedy, in addition, was just enough, mainly produced by the character.

(Source: DramaFever) ","Gong Seung Yeon, Jeon Hyo Sung, Park Hye Soo, Ye Ji Won, Yeon Woo Jin, Yoon Park",tvN,"Introverted Boss was a hard drama for me to like at first. This is one of those dramas that requires you to trust it will get better, and in my opinion it definitely did. Now that it's over, I can say that this is definitely a binge type drama, because if I had to wait days for the next episode I would have given up on this drama after episode 2. Halfway through I went from hating it to being totally invested. If you are unaware, like I was, that's because there was a major rewrite of the plot, and that strategy made all the difference. So about that plot...

I gave the story a decent score, only because I think the transformation was pretty impressive, but it was still imperfect in a lot of ways. My first problem with the story was that it didn't know whether it wanted to be a romantic comedy or a melodrama. The main plot revealed a very mysterious and serious backstory, then went into these weird slapstick comedy scenes that just didn't work together. One moment there is a revenge story brewing, then the next moment we are supposed to care about a CEO's anxiety issues, and the obviously planned romance between him and an obnoxious new hire. Add to that the fact that the CEO is too mysterious to be sympathetic, and The leading lady is the most annoying person on planet earth. The only thing that got me through in the beginning were the ""Another Miss Oh"" cameos, but I listened to viewers who said the story gets better after episode 5. In my opinion things don't start falling into place until episode 7, and that's when I knew I would probably become a fan. 

The writers do a great job of justifying the previous bad episodes while completely changing the drama into something more enjoyable. Still, even with the fixes to make it better, the flaw is in how bad the story premise is in the first place. In order to like this drama you can't dwell on how unrealistic the major event of the story is, and instead you have to just go along with the characters on this journey. The characters, and their rewrites, are what made me become a fan.

I eventually adored Yeon Woo Jin as Hwan Ki. This is, in my opinion, his best role so far. Maybe it's the fact that I relate to his shy/socially anxious character a lot, and I thought they did a good job of showing what it's like in a neurotic anxiety filled brain. I was truly impressed by how believable he was, and relatable, and empathetic, and totally unlike the ways I've seen him before. Some people may think it's too exaggerated, but I don't. I also relate to being thought of as scary and intimidating while I'm just sitting and thinking about something to myself. When it comes to his character, I think they nailed it. 

He is matched with Park Hye Soo, who's character I initially hated so much that in one scene she actually gets slapped, and I wanted to applaud. She was too pushy, too obnoxious, completely self involved, and not likable in the least. I'm sure the initial point was to create an opposites attract scenario, but they left her with no redeeming qualities, which made me think that the actress was just too young and out of his league. Eventually the rewrite calmed her down, made her more charming and less annoying, and that's when I realized that Hye Soo is really quite talented. I did end up liking them together, and rooting for them to succeed, in spite of the plot making that pretty hard to do. I started to actually see chemistry between them, and although they may not be among my favorite romance duos, I thought they worked well together. Many of their romantic scenes together made me smile, and there were no closed mouth lips barely touching kiss scenes either.  

My favorite amongst the rest of the cast was the silent monster staff. Once we were able to get to know their stories the office scenes became fun to watch. Their characters are comedically over the top, but still felt real and relatable. I just get excited seeing Ye Ji Won in anything now, but Heo Jeong Min was hilarious too... And I just rewatched ""Another Miss Oh"". My next favorite is Jang Hee Jin as Hwan Ki's first love, who was refreshingly different from what's often expected from that kind of role, and made that aspect of the story more entertaining.

The problem with Yoon Park as Kang Woo Il and Gong Seung Yeon as Yi Soo is that even with the rewrites they were still stuck in a melodrama storyline that made no sense to me, so it was impossible for them to not come across as extremely overdramatic at times. They did their best, but I cringed when that storyline would reappear. Writers did make both characters sympathetic, and saved them from becoming 2 dimensional, but their actions remained unbelievable to me, so I just preferred when they were not a major part of the story. Then there's also Lee Kyu Han who plays the ultimate buzzkill. His backstory is eventually explained too, but he kinda just pops out of nowhere at seemingly random times in the story, making it seem like he was only created to be a problem. 

If I ever watched this again it would be strictly for Yeon Woo Jin. I had a slight feeling of missing the cast when it was over, but really it's just his character that I am going to miss. I really related so much to him that I just may rewatch it someday... or maybe just clips. 

About the music... There are 2 songs form the soundtrack that stood out to me, so in my opinion it was better than ok, but not much better. 

Obviously I am biased against the melodramatic storyline, and more a fan of the shy boss rom com storyline, which I think saved this drama from being a major flop. Still, every aspect of the story is explained, and reexplained, and the writers seemed thorough about avoiding loose ends to the very end, which i appreciated. So yes, all questions get answered, even if the answers are hard to swallow. Also, even though some of the last episode seemed like filler, I loved the last moment, and thought it was a great way to end the story... a story who's major theme throughout is being able to express how you feel!

Overall I would recommend this drama for fans of unconventional rom coms with the warning that this story takes a loooooooooooong time to build. If you can sit through the first few episodes filled with annoying characters, misunderstandings, and over the top melodrama, you eventually get to a good story about becoming comfortable with who you are, your own style of being, and expressing how you feel, with a sweet but difficult love story as a bonus."

Bora is playing an adorable grim reaper by the name of Do Hye Na.  Do Hye Na has nothing going for her in this world, but when she passes away she meets a cook named Woo Shi Hyung, played by Kim Ji Suk, in the afterlife and they experience many episodes together in a pub called “Irish Uppercut.” ","Edward Kwon, Jang So Yeon, Kim  Mi Kyung, Kim Ji Suk, Lee Moo Saeng, Yoon Bora",Naver TV Cast,"Contrary to what the comments and ratings here on MDL show, 'Irish Uppercut' is truly a delight to watch! As someone who pays close attention to the comments before starting a drama/movie, I was pleasantly surprised (and thanked myself for choosing to completely ignore them) at how well made this little web series is. It totally deserves to be a proper drama (more on that later), and is a better investment of two hours than most other series.STORY: The plot description does not do this drama any justice. To be brief, Irish Uppercut is the name of a little restaurant set in purgatory (which just so happens to be the beautiful Jeju Island, though of course, with color distortions so you truly feel like you're in another dimension), run by Do Hae Na, a grim reaper who is not very good at her job. In order to keep her business up and running, Hae Na asks for help from Woo Shi Hyung, an arrogant chef who recently met his demise, while helping him participate in an Underworld Cooking Show Contest where the prize could very possibly mean a second chance at life for Shi Hyung.Of course, second chances, grim reapers, and purgatory are all themes that have been explored before, but Irish Uppercut does it a little differently. It focuses on a man's ambition to set his life straight (despite having been through hell  already) under any circumstances, even if it means betraying others. There's friendship, comedy, morality, and whole lot of good music. This is why Irish Uppercut deserves to be a full length drama: (referring to episode duration and not count) 8, hour long episodes would've been perfect for working out all the kinks, exploring character backstories and evolving the world under purgatory because there's so much that warrants explaining.ACTING: Kim Ji Suk is a great actor and he did his role complete justice. Same goes for Kim Mi Kyung, a veteran actress. Bo Ra didn't really have much to work with, and so she did pretty well with what little she had. However, the absolute star of the series was Lee Moo Saeng playing the role of Hae Na's (Bo Ra) older brother. He stole the show every time he was onscreen and his character was awesome! Truly the cherry on the cake.MUSIC: From hard rock to soothing ballads, this series really had it going in terms of music. Especially the song that Tae Min (Lee Moo Saeng) performs onstage, titled ""Boss, Please Bring Me Some Water."" It's hilarious, loud, and oddly touching, when watched in context of the scene itself. The full list of featured songs is available at the end credits of each episode, (or you can PM me for it.) Definitely worth checking out!REWATCH VALUE: I usually never rewatch anything because it remains fresh even if I watched it a long time ago (the cons of having a good memory xD) but this series can definitely be rewatched as it is light and enjoyable, with a sprinkling of important life lessons thrown in.OVERALL: I'd say definitely go for Irish Uppercut if you have two hours to spare. It can easily be enjoyed in one sitting, and still leave you with a happy feeling. Lee Moo Saeng's the MVP though! xD"

Which was confirmed very shortly within a handful of episodes. It was solidified even further when the female lead Lee Ga Ryeong dropped out of the drama by episode 46.

The first episode was pretty intriguing with a strong horror vibe but the story became a train wreck overtime with some disconnected storylines and a lot of (over)explanations regarding the plot. The actors were doing an OK job but were not helped at all by the wonky scenario. Indeed, it was very difficult to understand some of the characters' actions but also in particular to believe in the relationships between them. The bonds formed between the main female lead and the 2 main male leads seemed to become super strong too quickly which also led to some scenes feeling very flat. Clearly the series is lacking in many ways but still, there are some positives: the foreign actors acting was not atrocious (-which is pretty rare in K-drama universe), the visual FX were suitable, the fighting scenes were quite nicely produced, and Cha Eun Woo with his insane visual is real eye-candy in his role of priest Johan.

The part 2 of this drama suffers from the same defaults as its part 1. There are some big issues again with the pacing of the show. The last episode is pretty great but it is honestly very boring to get there. Most of the episodes leading to the finale contain too much flashbacks as well as ""false"" tension. Indeed, each time that a big moment happens it is counterbalanced and slowed-down. The lack of script content and strange screenplay choices are clearly the culprits in the show being so dull and anti-climatic. It is a shame that the screenwriter and director chose to spend time on what feel as ""fillers"" narrative arcs and repetition of the same scenes from the past rather than moving the plot forward in the present and building and developing the mythology of this universe. For example, the various powers of the trio of characters are cool but would have benefited of more explanations to properly onboard the viewer when they were revealed. It would also have been better to spend more time with the three main leads in order to deepen realistically the relationship between them. As in part 1, it was very difficult to be emotionally invested in those characters. I'm still not blaming the actors, they clearly do their best despite the lackluster and empty scenario. Despite the strangely paced story and odd directing choices, I found the photography beautiful, the visual FX very good and the overall production value pretty high; the scenery, the clothes, the weapons, the props and decors: everything is clearly high quality. I would not necessarily recommend this to people unless they have seen part 1 and like one of the main actors or the main actress (though the three of them have surprisingly what felt like little screen time)."

It should have ended after Shi Woo got out of the hospital by few episodes. Seo Hyo Rim had the least amount of screen-time during the last 24 episodes too, might be a reason for the direction it took. The drama itself is a generic melodrama in a business setting and all the business related shenanigans. The cast performance can be a big hit or miss depending on the scene. Both male leads were too stiff most of the time. Nothing stands out about the story, birth secret, rich/poor, in-laws ....etc, you know how it goes, prolonging everything to fill the time slot.

It's not preachy, it's not overly idealistic, it doesn't try to pretend to be extra woke, it's not trying to pass itself as an educational program- it's really just a touching story about three damaged, emotionally stunted people who are trying to get by.I am not a medical professional and I am not gonna waste time trying to analyze all the symptoms and guess the disorders and argue about that because that's grossly missing the point. The main focus of this drama was showing the pain, frustration and sorrow that comes with suffering from trauma, dealing with conditions out of your hands and the hurt that comes with mental illness for both who have it and their family members. But most of all it highlights the strength of these people, about how they help each other and get help from each other to make things a bit better.It beautifully expresses themes of understanding, resilience, love and friendship between people who've had a very tough life. Ofcourse, in typical K drama fashion, it's not without its cheesy tropes, cliches and some flair for dramatics but despite all of that it gets the message across in a powerful manner.The beauty of it is that despite being filled with heartbreaking and  emotional moments that make you shed tears and snot, it never lets the dark side become overpowering by adding much needed comic relief and heart warming moments that make you giggle and feel good inside.There is extra charm in people who are beautiful AND excellent actors. All the cast delivers phenomenally with the two main leads having electric chemistry with each other and sharing  glorious, steamy kisses that will go down in k drama history. ;)The show is easy to watch with a bit of suspense, thrill, murder mystery, psychotic parents and drama mixed with emotion, heart and healing. It's fast paced peppered with wholesome slow moments and amazing character growth.Seo Ye Ji's impulsive, passionate, gorgeously dressed, blunt, morally questionable female lead with childlike tendencies is undoubtedly a crowd favorite. On the other hand, Kim Soo Hyun's handsome, selfless, persevering male lead with bambi eyes and a mutinous heart brings his own to the table.Finally, bringing them both together, the veteren Oh Jung Sae brought forth an endearing character suffering from autism who is extremely pure hearted and just trying his best. The moments between these three are powerful and literally make you pray for these people and their happiness. The side characters are all relevant and enhance the flavor of the show The OST is stunning, the direction is beautiful and the pretty story telling incorporating scary fairytales and creepy animations brings everything full circle.It's definitely binge worthy and a full of feeling ride that you don't want to miss.Enjoy!"

I highly recommend that you watch the drama first before watching this drama. You will find me comparing both dramas in this review, it's apple to apple comparison, read on my review and I will explained why I recommend to watch the drama first. What I like:The cinematography is gorgeous and beautifully shot, there are many beautiful sceneries, the use cgi to illustrate and explain example how youngshil's clock works. There are a few moments in the show that are unexpectedly funny that makes me laugh out loud. Nice cameos from the 2008 drama actors are in this drama. (you will recognize them if you have watch the 2008 drama) Music is nice and blend well with the scenes. Issues I have: (yes, I have a lot of issues) The show title is called Jang Young Shil , you would thought the show main focus would be on the main character but no, its the same issue I have with The Great King Sejong drama, the show as well focuses a lot of side characters. Especially the political parts which I would never fully understand if I had not watch the 2008 drama. The difference is this drama side characters plot / story doesn't have direct impact / consequence to the main character's story in addition most of the side characters are one-note and bland which only added to unnecessary screen time, making the story very messy. Even though Kim Sang Kyung and Kim Yeong Cheol have reprised the same characters as the year 2008 drama, the characters they are portraying are quite different from this drama. I feel their acting in this drama not as strong as the previous drama.The main character Jang Young Shil, there's not much character development from start to end, which is a huge issue to me because if the character has no much depth then it is flat. I'm sure a lot of people have watched the first Iron man man movie, imagine Tony stark's character and personality is the same even after the things he had gone through throughout the movie. The drama will tend to show his almost finished invention without explaining how he makes it, comparing to the first Iron man movie again, it's as if the movie show the finished product of the iron man suit without the scenes of his thought process and trial-and-error into making the suit. I also do not buy into the close friends relationship with king Sejong and Young Shil by comparing with 2008 drama, you will see what I meant. The princess sohyun character is unnecessary in the show, think her character is only there to serve as a love interest, there episodes she is not in it I don't feel I am missing that character."

I like the two male leads as well, and this looked to be a fairly fun romance story. 

The first half of this show, I was utterly in love with it. I re-watched episodes as I waited for new ones to air. But I made the fatal mistake of falling for the second male lead, knowing that the writers would break my heart and his. The show starts off by throwing a huge cast of characters at us, and their relations seem a little confusing at first. But, eventually, all is sorted, and we have ourselves with 3 main love triangles. Pyo Na Ri, who has been in a 3 year one-sided love with Lee Hwa Shin, and then meets and falls for his best friend and ultimate chaebol gentleman, Go Jung Won. This is our main triangle and love story. The others are played up at first but slowly get pushed to the background....just like our 2nd lead. I blame the writers for making Jung Won such a perfect catch (and Go Kyung Pyo for making Jung Won seriously swoony) that he was hard to get over. Whereas, in contrast Hwa Shin could be a perfect donkey's behind...yet somehow you couldn't hate him because he also showed that he cared about everyone in his life as well. He was definitely tortured by his own inner self. 

The story had some serious moments that the writers cut with humorous moments, so the weightier matters didn't drag the show into melodrama territory. There were strong characters and great chemistry with ALL the cast members. The writers did a fantastic job with the casting, and it could not have been more perfect. Up until around episode 14, I was sure that this might be the best drama I had ever watched and I fully expected to see it on my list of favorites. But the writers started to make some missteps in the story from my point of view. And I know that the majority of viewers may disagree with me. I did not feel that way simply because my 2nd lead wasn't getting the girl. Hwa Shin was not a bad choice for Pyo Na Ri. They did have some great chemistry together and I could see where the Hwa Shin ""shippers"" could be all on board with him. But I wasn't as swayed as I could have been and the actions of the characters didn't seem honorable to me in that mid-point. It dampened my love for the show somewhat, and that never fully recovered. Jealousy Incarnate was still a good show and I looked forward to it every week. I think they wrapped up the story well and completely for our main couple. However, they left a lot of loose ends when they backburnered the side characters that were prominent in the first several episodes. 

My favorite side characters may have been the doctor and her nurse. Nurse Oh stole every scene she was in, and the doctor was both funny and full of heart. 
The music was great - seriously stand out. I'm not normally into the music so much, but there were several songs that I had to hunt down and play for my own enjoyment of them. 

Please, do give this show a chance (and push through past the first couple of episodes if it's hard - it's worth it!). You'll have lots of laughter and emotions."

The second couple was pretty entertaining and interesting too, and they were the only thing that kept me from giving up on this drama. Because after the first episodes, they seemed to forget about the going back in time, only bring it up from time to time with the track and some batteries thrown here and there, and they focused on the political drama and how the characters blended in  their new environment. The drama forgot also about the main character's archery skills, the murderer and his serial killing cases and the romance of the doctor and the main character, not to mention the rebel that had to take action sooner or later. These all were all added in the final episode when they wrapped everything up. The ending, finally, was okay, with satisfying conclusions for all of them.

It wasn't perfect, but I still think it was worth a watch and is a super cute office romance comedy. If nothing else, do it for Choi Daniel! :) But I have to say that Baek Jin Hee was bringing the cute in spades! I was anticipating a much higher score for this, if the ending hadn't fallen just a little flat for me. Like the writers got close to the end and then just weren't quite sure how to wrap everything up. I did enjoy the epilogues of the characters even if it wasn't *quite* what I was hoping for or expecting for our main characters.The office hijinks played a large part in this show, as the description indicates. However, the office stuff was also kind of where its weak point lay as well. I enjoyed the burgeoning relationship between our leads, Chi Won and Yoon Yi, and the antics of their office department. They had a great supporting cast there. Lee Won Keun as Hwangbo Yul, although mostly a character I sympathized with, also had quite silly and annoying moments of aegyo because he's basically a man-child. Kang Hye Jung as his assistant Wang Jung Ae was just the mothering, loyal assistant he needed. I think they did a pretty decent job with the comedy parts of the show as well as the romance parts. There were lots of laughs and a few swoon-y moments as well. :)The theme song was catchy - I caught myself singing it a few times.I would say that this is a fairly decent romantic comedy as long as you don't set your expectations too high. It's cute and fun as long as that's all you are asking from it because the plot is a bit thin. I was just able to overlook that until it got down to the final episodes, and I realized that I wasn't going to get all the answers I was looking for. I would still recommend this to rom-com fans.As far as re-watches go...I'd say there are several episodes and scenes that I'd watch again, but I don't know if I would do a complete run through again."

Going in, I was totally unaware of what I was getting into. I hadnt read its synopsis, reviews, related comments and mostly flicked past the screencaps in the feeds. So in the first half as I realized what the drama was about, it hit me personally because of multiple reasons. I wanted it to be more raw and painful at times and at others, it got so real that I had to press pause and take a break from my own thoughts.Then, somewhere in between Just Between Lovers took a turn down the typical K-Drama alley. It became overly melodramatic and sappy. In order to create a tragic hero, they piled every problem possible in the world on his beautiful shoulders and there was only so much I could buy before I started giving it the side-eye. Physical health problems gave precedence to mental. I wont say that it romanticized mental illness but it did gloss over it all. PTSD does not randomly vanish like this.However, despite all this, one thing that was very clear to me at the end of it all was how much I enjoyed this show throughout. I was even more relieved than disappointed because of all the tropes it chose to follow because they provided the much needed escapism we look for in dramas. Even though, it dealt with heavy issues it didnt drown in it. There was always a comedic gesture, a heartwarming moment and a swoon-worthy interaction between the leads to balance things out.I think this drama had one of the best K-Drama romances ever. This was exactly the kind of relationship I fall for. It was a beautiful slow burn, where two people grow individually and together. They go through obstacles, they have their highs and lows and they become stronger through them- both in harmony and independently. And, it was all absolutely beautiful to watch. Ive never been this starved for skinship between the leads and when it finally happened, it was so sweet and intimate that it was worth the wait.Both the main leads were very dear to me. Gang Doo was simply an angel. I dont think people like him exist in this world anymore but it would be a huge relief if they did. Moon Soo, even though some of her actions at the end were questionable was undeniably a sweetheart. There were some side characters I was lowkey annoyed with (Think: Second Male Lead, Second Female lead (though she had her moments) and the female leads parents) because of how much they victimized themselves even when other people had it far worse. But at the same time, I also adored a lot of other characters. Like basically everyone related to Gang Doo; his grandmother, his Doona, his brother figure and his team leader. You know what they say, good people are surrounded by good people.As far as the acting goes, I wont say it was exceptionally outstanding or that I was floored by it. Their inexperience and freshness shined through however, this worked out in their favor. Because the way the two portrayed their characters was so sincere and natural that it didnt fail to capture the audience and touch hearts.One of the best things about the show is the OST. I really recommend watching this show in a print that has the songs subbed while they play in the background. The lyrics are so meaningful to the plot and the play timing is perfect. So when you know what the songs are saying at a particular moment, it gives all the more depth and insight to the story. And its simply gorgeous.So ultimately, Just Between Lovers is a show about healing, friendship, love, serenity and brilliant dialogues. Even though it develops slowly and maximizes emotion, its never boring. There are some tears here and there but with that comes so much more hope and so much more warmth.Definitely recommend.Enjoy!"

Young Mi being the ""behind the scene heart of the story"". I have to say, her and Hyeon Woo's scenes were some of my favorites and I was always curious where they would lead. Hyeon Woo has been just a huge mystery and I never knew what the heck he was thinking. There is also baby boy Dae Jin, who broke my heart.

The main character being the weakest one?The confusion I felt from the writing team. As if they could not make up their minds on what the drama is supposed to be.

Who is at fault when a child commits a crime? Juvenile Justice tries to present the complexity of the issue, and for the most part, it succeeds (as much as a fictional drama can). It presents kids as both the victims and perpetrators, rightfully pointing out the roles are not mutually exclusive. It shows the effects of neglect, bad or lack of role models, abuse. A small group of people trying to do their best in the system that does not support their efforts and does not protect the people it was created to protect. While showing the gruesome reality, it sticks to a more positive, but still realistic approach. Often justice is served, but only in the frame of the current juvenile court system, that for many is not harsh enough. From the first, till the last episode the drama does not fail to keep the tension high, keeping me on the edge of my seat. The cases are not one dimensional, showing different sides and perspectives, at times, leaving me with only one conclusion: everyone failed - the parents, the teachers, the judges, the kids themselves. The plot and presentation wise, the only thing that it lacks in my eyes is the context some of the kids were in. What pushed them to become what they are? What could be the possible motives for their actions? What behavior was a norm in their house? These are the questions I hoped to get a more elaborated answer for than a short note abused by step-father in the case file. Moving back to the positive aspects: I appreciate how we do not get an outstanding character development from any of the main cast. They all made mistakes, they all got carried away by their emotions and fears. That said, how they handled Na Geun Hees character by the end of the show left me with a few things to desire. Did not buy that arc, which might have been the result of the lack of the screen time. Acting wise - no complaints. For a show full of the younger cast, all kids and teens did an amazing job with presenting their characters. Especially impressed by Lee Yeon. To present a believable acting of a teenage boy, when she is a 27 years old woman, must have been  quite a challenge. As for the production, even the opening scene made me love the visuals of the drama. The dark and cold tones used throughout the show intensified the gloomy atmosphere surrounding tacked topics. Trigger warning - the drama presents quite a number of scenes showing child abuse. They are not short, they are not vague. Overall, as long as you can handle child abuse and exploitations of children, this is a drama most people should watch. Understanding that kids are capable of doing evil acts is a first step to figure out how to prevent tragedies from happening. Turning a blind eye and giving excuses is not a solution, as it gives only one message: no matter how drastic  measures you will take, no one will care. Supporting them through their struggles while punishing for the wrong actions should become a standard."

This is one of the better tightly written Korean drama about bending time. The episodes were tense and fast paced and will keep at the edge of your seats. The time bending rules were mostly consistent all through out the show. If there were any plotholes these were very trivial. I may not like every character's decisions, esp Aeri's mom but it was understandable. Terrific acting from the entire cast! They were so good, esp Shin Seung Rok and Lee Se Young. I loved their team work and how they were able to beat the odds and find out the truth. The ending was satisfying, as the show was able to wrap their stories neatly except for 2 people, i wanted their ending to be different, but it was still fine.

A fun soft makjang - technically there are a lot of makjang like plots, but they are not overdramatized in presentation. A well executed take on questionable and toxic decision making, when people are so hungry for power, respect, love, admiration, control (you name it).Lets start with the fact this is not really a strong female leads being badass type of a show. All free leads are emotionally broken in one way or another, selfish, egocentric and cunning. None was worth rooting for and thats exactly what made the drama a fun watch - you could see them messing with each other's lives, laugh about it and not feel many conflicting emotions. Character wise, both Go Mo Ran and Bae Ok Sun were fascinating. Completely misguided in their actions, created an avalanche of devastating situations that only made them both feel more frustrated, sad, angry. On the other hand, Woo Hyun was simply poorly written, and the performance by Kim Ha Neul did not help either. Lack of development, ambiguous morals, questionable motivation - this character more or less served nothing. Production and directing wise, it was fine until it was not. Last two episodes are a pacing nightmare sprinkled with confusing editing. Sadly, the director and production team did not know how to deal with the cut of two episodes, making it impossible to deliver a proper closure that did not feel rushed and out of the blue.

From the first episode to the last, the plot moved fast with barely a boring moment. The drama also had one of the best soundtracks to really enhance the intensity of a particular moment and hype you up. However, story-wise this wasn't anything new for a k-drama. You've most probably seen it all before a hundred times.As far as the acting went, it was nothing out of the world but it did meet the bar required to effectively tell the story of the characters. The male lead made me care for him despite the fact that he had the same expression throughout the show. It worked in his favor too and sold the ""serial killer with a good heart"" persona quite well. The female lead was your standard formulaic supposedly 'strong' heroine. Conveniently playing the damsel in distress when it mattered and the right amount of dumb to keep prolonging the story. There were some very interesting side characters that I wanted to know more about and see our hero interact with but I guess the creators were short of time.I did feel that there was more action and less depth in the drama. You feel for the characters but not enough to really be invested. Regardless, it's an excellent time-pass. There are some very heavy moments, some good dialogue and badass fighting sequences to keep you hooked. While I don't think this drama is something that stays with you long after you finish it, I do think it's good while it lasts.Enjoy!"

(Source: MyDramaList) Edit Translation  English Русский Türkçe Português","Hwang Jung Eum, Ji Sung, Kim Yoo Ri, Kim Young Ae, Oh Min Suk, Park Seo Joon",MBC,"While I was watching this drama, I kept going through these rabid fangirl moments where I recited in my head, the praises I would sing for it after I completed it, but as I write this now; words simply elude me. I'm emotionally spent, harboring a subtle lingering ache in my heart and overcome by a deep sense of satisfaction all at the same time. All these emotions are making it extremely hard for me to explain in just a few words what this drama truly made me feel because the truth is; you don't just watch Kill me, Heal me- you experience it, you breathe it and it morphs into unrelenting claws and keeps you with it till the end.  Ji Sung- I have so much love for this man. He captures my soul every time he comes on-screen. He has always been one of my two most favorite actors and will always remain that way. I can sing odes in way of his acting and it still wouldn't be enough. In this drama he plays a Chaebol with 7 different personalities and his transitions are so real and vivid, that each of the seven personalities seem like entirely different people.   Shin Se Gi= The over dramatic bad boy who made me giggle, swoon, cry and fall in love.  Yona= The side-throbbingly hilarious and bratty mean girl who I wished I was friends with.  Ah Sub= The genius and serious teenager who had a penchant for suicide.  Perry Park= The ahjussi who shined so brightly and tinkered with bombs for fun.  Nana= The child without a voice.  Mr. X= The man who brought forth reason and rationale when Do Hyun was truly ready to embrace himself.  Cha Do Hyeon= The beautiful and complex man who suffered so much and yet, never stopped fighting.  I used to believe in the stupid ""real men don't cry"" stereotype that our society worships. I was so awful that if a hero in a show I was watching cried, I'd think him weak and turn away but Korean Dramas changed it for me. Korean characters often communicate with their tears, the feelings they don't verbalize, express themselves in the way of salty water. Tears are not a sign of weakness, they are a sign that you're alive. Cha Do Hyeon often had tears leaking from his eyes and every single time they moved me. Sometimes my heart hurt from all the pain, sometimes my lips hurt from smiling wide. His tears were gorgeous as was his struggle and will to become whole again.  Ji Sung deserved that Daesang and more.  People call Ji Sung the king of Kill Me, Heal Me and he no doubt is but what many don't say is that Hwang Jung-Eum was also undeniably the queen. I've heard many complaints about how Jung-Eum screams too much, how her obnoxious loud voice is unbearable, how she over acts and tries hard and frankly, I think all these people are just tripping. True, she does shout more than is necessary and she'll probably rupture your ear drum with all the noise she makes, yet there is not a single other actress who can even dream to properly pull off the roles she has executed.  She always grows on you and makes it work. She is the Empress of expressions and I don't know why but whenever she cries ( and she cries a lot and it's rather ugly) I always cry too. I don't even know why. I love her so much and to this day, she's one of my favorite actresses. The roles she plays, whether it's the self-sacrificing woman in Secret or the scarred psychiatrist in KMHM, always show inner strength. Oh Ri JIn is a brilliant, full of light and empathetic woman whose strength knows no bounds.   Ji Sung and Hwang Jung-Eum are undoubtedly the Korean industry's most powerful pairing. They are both excellent actors in their own right and together they are undeniably magic. Their chemistry is off the fucking charts. They move in sync and it's apparent how much they understand each other. Secret had left an impression on me and yet, KMHM without being influenced by that, made its own indent in my heart. Usually, in K-dramas the female character is overshadowed by the male's but Ji Sung and Hwang Jung-Eum exhibit equality of the sexes. They are both formidable players at their game and they play effortlessly together and bring the victory home, every single time. Despite the fact that Ji Sung's role was very powerful, Jung-Eum held her own and due to that, they co-existed beautifully.  Then comes Oh Ri On. Ah, my baby. He was also one of the best characters in the show and literally the best brother ever. He loves her but he let's her go. Park Seo Joon couldn't have done a better job in my opinion.  Every single actor from top to bottom brought their greatest to this drama and made it the masterpiece it was. I think it's rightfully one of the best Korean productions ever made. It had me bawling and heaving at one point and clutching my stomach laughing and gasping for breath at another. It made me feel bittersweet melancholy, made my heart fill with warmth and made me be so unwilling to let it go that despite dying with curiosity, I wanted to prolong it in some way so that it wouldn't end. This drama has pain yet joy, tears yet laughter, incredible heartbreak yet so much love. Not a single second is filler, it's filled to the brim with powerful dialogues and the suspense element is excellently done. You simply cannot get better than KMHM.  The OST (Auditory Hallucination) is definitely one of the best ever made. It always played on the perfect time and made the already soul stirring scenes a thousand times more impactful.  Yes, there were some medical errors in the drama but despite that, mental illness and trauma have been wonderfully explored to their core. It offered a peek in the life of a man waging war against his own mind and how an equally scarred woman became his sword and together they were conquerors.  This drama showed everything that makes Asian dramas so raw and poignant. If you haven't watched this and you call yourself a K-drama fan, I say you need to check your priorities.  Rewatch value is worth more than can be described. The moment I even begin to forget it (which will be hard) I'll watch it again because I never want to lose all that I felt while I was on the journey of watching Kill Me, Heal Me. I am sincerely thankful to Jin Soo-wan for writing this gem."

I was hopeful that this would give me the warm and fuzzy I was looking for. The series starts out at a descent pace and you get an opportunity to see our two leads in their youth. It was fun  and gave you the young love feeling. Their personality/character was revealed in the beginning so there is no mystery about whether or not they are bad or good. You can just tell. You will get a lot off political scheming and a hint romance (thats right a hint). Although our leads performed well together you you dont get to see the real chemistry between them together/together. You know they have feelings/love each other but you dont feel it.This series definitely highlights reform int this culture in the sense of foreigners, trade expansion and etc. I believe the overall premise for the series was growth of the culture, Progression and adapting. Well displayed.What I enjoyed most about the series was the acting. The overall plot was well maintained.What I didnt like was the the lack of clarity and  gaps. So many things were left out. How do I know? There were so many 3 years later or 1 year laters. After a while things got a bit confusing. There was a sudden infatuation by a character. Just strange.   In truth, after the female leads identify was revealed I couldnt understand why she lived where she lived and why these people were left to care for her. These things made absolutely no sense to me. I do love the male leave. He starred in a similar series title princess man.  Some of the same events happen.Important notes-90% politics -little to no romance but you do get love- nice fight scenes.-no redemption for those that were done wrong (yeah, you heard me)-no major power plays (aka -shocker moment)"

And while the FL in Cha Cha takes a turn to the annoying this one is mostly good from start to finish. what Cha Cha had that this one did not have was a beautiful bromance.

In 2019 the cine drama was born. This describes a kind of hybrid production with film studios being involved in drama series and movie directors hired for the production. Cinematic camera  therefore has since then become characteristic. ""Kingdom"" was the first original Netflix KDrama production and is thus repeatedly mentioned as a pioneer in this cine drama genre.""Kingdom"" is an impressive, idiosyncratic mix of colourful historical drama and bloody zombie thriller.In the broadest sense, the story relates to the so-called Imjin War, the Japanese invasion between 1592 and 1598. --------------- SIDE NOTE: History meets fictionThe KDrama specifically (but losely) refers to the Battle of Sangju (1592) in the Upo Wetlands. At that time General Yi Il had the problem that he only had a cavalry of 60 soldiers while he was supposed to stop the Japanese on their advance from Busan to Hanseomg. However, his assigned company, which was supposedly equipped and trained first-class, did actually not exist or was not operational. Either the original soldiers were sick, dead, or gone. The local garrisons were also empty because the soldiers stationed there had been recalled to Daegu. What he got were untrained civilians. With the grain he found in a warehouse, he was at least able to recruit some of them. However, he no longer had time to prepare the ca. 900 commoners for the battle, because the Japanese were already there.The KDrama picks up on this moment in Korean history and rewrites the story in a zombi spirit: In that desperate battle, the former governor of the southern Chungcheong province, Ahn Hyeon, ultimately took command and led around 500 Koreans against an overpowering army of around 30,000 Japanese. The Koreans were victorious thanks to an unknown ""resurrection plant"" that can be used to resurrect the deceased as bloodthirsty zombies and, with a little skill, can be used as weapons. So (at least in KDrama) the battle in the wetlands could still be won.------------------------------------------------------------Otherwise, the historical setting provides the hook for an epic journey into bygone times with stately costumes and impressive (authentic South Korean) landscape shots, elaborate details and bloodthirsty butchery. (As adult Netflix production this KDrama is exceptionally brutal). The zombies, with their horde-like appearance and yet very idiosyncratic ""fighting style"", provide a change from the classic battle formations and martial art sword fights, causing a real challenge for the experienced generals as the opponents are already dead... It requires intelligence, creativity and, above all, high speed. The story itself progresses at this high pace. Neverthelss the emotionally essential scenes have been captured in the proven KDrama style: slowly, intimately and with maximum intensity.As so often it is just a few powerful, scheming people who make life difficult or even impossible for the many. Yet, not only these political intrigues are the driving force of this thriller. First and foremost it is the question about the epidemic origin and how it might be defeated.Answers to this question require a second season, even a KMovie and most probably a third season, too. Additionally another film spin-off is being planned. Obviously the story about the ""resurrection plant"" is far from being told. ... and I am ready to set out again with the noble crown prince to find a solution to save his people and the future of his country in the face of this locust-like zombie plague.

I kinda thought that would be her at the end but I was disappointed..I could go actually complain more about the characters, but I'd still watch s3 even if it's just for Lee Chang's bearded look ;pand honestly, this was like a chain of unfortunate events and battle scenes, so I don't think a rewatch would be necessary.."

That said the drama may be all about kisses but our male lead is so much more showing a bunch of emotions, smiles and pretty much acting like the perfect guy any human being would fall for. The female leads  (Jeon Hye Won) character is a tad conservative in her views on kissing but her hate towards human beings is very admirable as well as well portrayed and slightly relatable, luckily I found my own goblin so I do know there are some good ones out there but with toxic masculinity and gender conventions a slight hate towards man kind is only natural and indeed well portrayed in this very short production. The Jeon Hye Wons character may be lovely but her acting skills could be improved, the friendships here are the type you will long for but for such a short what I assume is not very high budget show it tackles some issues, has both slightly less predictable and more predictable twists as well as tells a pretty decent story. All in all a short and enjoyable watch P.S 8,5 rating is based the titles category and other similar productions, so set your expectations towards 12 min/12 episode web dramas and not a full length drama"

However, reading the genres and tags, ""Kiss Sixth Sense"" is not what I was expecting.  I thought this is a true romantic comedy with mature adults, maybe a little more mature version of ""A Business Proposal"" with a fantasy twist.  What I ended up watching is comedy + romance + fantasy + suspense + crime.  This results in the drama having an identity crisis and not doing any of the genre well.This is really disappointing as I was looking forward to something light and fun, but with adults who look their age in the business world.  The comedy in the initial episodes were a little over-the-top for my taste, but that's OK as I thought this is a comedy.  The fantasy element is interesting and I am always a fan of fantasy romance drama.  However, when they added the very-Korean childhood connection and trauma, and the half-baked suspense into a 12-episode drama, everything feels underdeveloped, rushed and disjointed.I actually quite like the romantic chemistry between the leads.  I am all for bickering couples who are secretly in love with each other.  However, I still don't see when Fl starts to fall in love with ML, as she only wants to find out what the future holds.  That's been such a big build up for many episodes about this future event FL sees with ML, but because those future scenes occur so often throughout 2/3 of the drama, it was quite anti-climatic when that significant event really happens.  There's nothing the audience doesn't already know. Acting is decent, though some scenes are quite cringey when the leads finally get together.  ML seems to have changed to another person once he's in love.  Where's that cool, calm and collected leader?  Now we have a lovesick puppy vying for kisses whenever he can.  There are scenes when he's kissed or kisses FL and he doesn't seem to be in pain.  Whereas, other scenes he is pain even when FL is right beside him.  Is that a plot hole that I detected?  Or I am not understanding his condition?The secondary romance between the cousin and the doctor is underwhelming.  You can skip the whole thing and not miss a beat.  Yes, the last 15 minutes are weird and unnecessarily long.  I think I know where the scriptwriters are coming from, showing us a different kind of relationship.  But, maybe they can reduce those scenes to 5 minutes instead.Overall, it's an easy binge and if you have nothing to watch, this hodgepodge drama is OK.  At least there are plenty of kisses (but not as many steamy kisses as I anticipated given the premise of the significant event)."

Watched on Viki.Content Warnings: hypnotizing someone against their will and biting their lips, murders/death, gore/bloodWhat I Liked- the premise of a vampire wanting to become human instead of the other way around (a la Twilight)- I liked that the college student didn't just ghost/run away, but he's really pretty dumb to be alone with vampires...- good production valueRoom For Improvement- this was some really awful writing, the ending was absolutely abysmal. They could have had some smart plot twists but did not. I need another vampire BL that is done well  to destroy my memory of this one. - they needed to cut characters and really build the relationship between the vampire and college student, they spend like 2 hours together and are soulmates...- the explanation 10 years ago was disappointing, I thought there was more too it but basically the main vampire was just stupid- the treatment of his friend (for hundreds of years!!!) at the end was awful. Jun Ho was actually worse when you think about it.- I'm not even going to get into the just odd/unexplained/poorly thought out world building- some odd camera shots, too many close ups- way too many flashbacks that were used as filler- the extreme blur filter that made the vampire look like a ghost"

FL in the past: Seol Hui- Hangul: - Hanja:  which means snow.2. FL in 2023: Han Gye Jeol- Hangul: -  in Hanja is:  which means season- According to Kokdu, her name means Spring. Or, something that was in Winter (her past self) that reached Spring, the changing of Seasons (her 2023 name).The FL's past and 2023 names are tied to each other. They were never meant to be together in the past, because that past was the beginning of their winter fate.However, when she was reborn in the present time, she was given the name Gye Jeol. A sign that the winter __season__ is about to end, and the a new __season__ is going to begin. New beginnings. New hope.And as Kokdu realised, her names mean exactly that. Winter to Spring seasons. From dark and cold, to bright/light and warm.3. ML in the past: Oh Hyun- Hangul:  - means ""five strings"". -- He came back after 5 years.- Hanja: There are many possible Hanja to his name, but the Hangul itself already has a meaning.I tried to find other references to five, but found none. The strings can mean fate.Other Hanja variations of  are ""to meet"", or ""bright""; ""crow"", ""black"".Other Hanja variations of  are ""wepp"", or ""swift"", or ""bow string"", or ""black"".If we consider the possible Hanja characters and meanings, a picture starts to form why he was named Oh Hyun in the past, and why everything ended up the way it all did.And let's be reminded, Kokdu is Oh Hyun stuck as a god of the afterlife. It still is his name, so, he's living true as Oh Hyun.4. ML as a god: Kokdu- Hangul: - Hanja: n/aI think there's no need to speculate on Kokdu.Another good thing. The ending was not something expected. There were similar supernatural romance before, and usually they have similar endings. This TV series chose a path less shown in K-dramas."

By golly they played the same song over and over in EVERY LAST EPISODE!!! I know in the story it held sentimental value but boy did they play it too much. I could only imagine how many times they played that song  during the many takes they did.Now the story. I can't describe the plot because I couldn;t tell if it was strong or weak. I did get a sense of how the main character-Yoon Kye Sang was in the 15th episode. It was loosely portrayed in the beginning but throughout the series it just focused on him being homeless and befriending other homeless people and battling goons who abused their power to the weaker homeless people. I was upset because there was a part in the series where Kye Sang claimed he was going to take care of the worst top level goons and then that scenario faded as quickly as it came so I wonder what was the point of putting that in the series. There were a few characters that I couldn't stand: Park Ye Jin. Her face was so botoxed that she couldn't even cry right. She looked pasty and too thin. Her annoying one expression through the whole series was nerve wrecking. I also couldn't stand Gu Jae Yi character. She was heartless to the end!My favorite was Park Won Sang. I remembered him from several dramas and I loved him in every last one of those.As I mentioned earlier about the plot, sometimes the main character's actions was wishy washy. I don't know if the writers wanted him to play a good guy or a bad guy so they just went for both and at one point I was glad he-well, I can't give away too much of the spoilers.I liked the chemistry the cast had. It wasn't strong but it was good.I don't know how I feel about the last episode. At one point they should've ended it but they extended it. I don't know if they needed to fill in some time so they just added another segment or they just wanted to add more to the end just because. Then there's that 'we've done all we could do so let's just end it here' kind of thing and it was over.I would've dropped this but I dropped two other dramas and I needed something to fill my void until the regular NFL season starts. When it does, I will be putting my Korean dramas on the back burner until the NFL season ends. Maybe by then my drought will be over and I will be able to find better dramas to watch."

Though it would be more realistic if his issues were more to do with dealing with the negative side of fame which was also brought up rather than merely hating the way he looks. I am glad I watched this series because Han Seung Yeon tugged at my heart strings with her character,  Baek Se. The moment where she talks to her friend made me well up. Beautifully portrayed moments.Since Dong Jong was made to play the part of the romance star, Ji Sul Woo, lots of light hearted moments came from reenacting famous romance scenes. Though there are no laugh out loud moments, it's still entertaining. Two 1 hour episodes makes it an easy watch and the story ending was well done.It's unfortunate that Lee Seo Won misbehaved and threatened a female. He seems to be a good actor. It just goes to show that just because someone is talented, they may not be a good person and as the audience we only see their onscreen persona and the side they want us to see. Nonetheless, my rating is based on the story and the combined effort of all the actors and the work put in.

Lesson:In this age, at times it may feel like the law is not just. But remember, one can never hide the truth for long, it ultimately surfaces. Hence, law is imperfect justice, but it destroys those who do not fear it!  Nutshell Review: The drama is centered around a law school - its students and professors. Starting with a murder case in the campus, the students, professors, law-keepers and politicians are thrown into the mix, trying to solve it while digging long buried truths of their own. Through the main case and the intertwined cases, we see how a group of students learns, overcome their own faults with their professors guiding them. They come to know the ones who abide by the law and how some can even bend it to their own favor - ultimately it being a test of their integrity and consciousness to stand by the truth and law, which is above all.  Detailed Review: This drama is for YOU, if you like to watch a show with: Intriguing PLOT:  fast paced, edgy and thrilling courtroom drama exceptional, par brilliant acting and dialogue delivery - especially Kim Myung Min [hats-off]   crisp storylines and thought-provoking cases mysterious and keeps you guessing whodunnit till the end law jargons and events explained well, like teaching audience in a classroom [live up to drama name, Law ""School""] ensemble cast with individual stories that intertwine with main story good wins over evil story OR Truth Triumphs in the long run story [feel-good factor] great cinematography - especially with close-ups and transitions even if you make mistakes, if you own up to them and do the right in the end = redemption each episode ends with a justified cliffhanger, than urges you to binge watch it cause it is too good to be put downBrilliant CAST and ACTING:  Kim Myung Min: This is my first time watching him in action and what a treat. His screen presence and aura is literally, palpable through the screen. He has the undivided attention of the viewers as well as the actors in the scene with him, as soon as he enters a room, or speaks. Sheer acting finesse, and all praises for him are justified. Actors are of his caliber are what we would call as gems of a lifetime!  Kim Bum: This is my second drama of the actor, after the old sensation and my first K-drama, Boys Over Flowers. He still carries his boyish charm, but what we saw as a flicker of good acting in BoF is fully unleashed in his calm, calculating and brilliant demeanor and portrayal of a law student.  Lee Jun Eun: Effortless as always. I have always mostly seen her in support roles, but what a presence this lady has. She can flip from your cute, bubbly next-door ahjumma to a sharp, tongue-tying woman in a jiffy.  Notable mentions: Ahn Nae Sang, Woo Hyun, Park Hyuk Kwon, Lee Chun Hee and Jo Jae Ryong. Their screen time might have been less, but their effervescent acting was mighty felt. Again, some of the amazing actors who you may see in many other dramas in support roles and they never disappoint in whatever role they take up! Why I Picked this Drama (and maybe why should you too) I am a sucker for courtroom dramas, and this one went beyond the usual by showcasing it from the classroom angle I like plots which can keep you guessing till the end, and give a satisfying ending led by great acting If you like western movies like - A Few Good Men, The Lincoln Lawyer, Primal Fear - definitely watch this drama. You will not regret and add it to your favorites.  If you appreciate, stories within a story - then you will love the narration of this drama!"

There are some tropes that will always and I really do mean always happen in these shows. Let me count them down with you: 1)Corrupt people in power who have successfully fooled the public into believing that they are good. 2)Our underdog hero and heroine who have a tragic past caused by the above mentioned corrupt people in power. 3)Our hero and heroine having coincidentally linked childhood history of some sorts. 4)An abundance of convenient plot-devices and complications that happen just for the sake of happening.5)Rushed endings.6)Our hero having magical powers that makes him have an IQ of 269, ninja fighting skills and a slightly whacked emotional quotient. Yeah in 9/10 K-crime/law dramas this will happen. I bet my left tit on it. So if you are going to wear your granny glasses and make these the basis of judging what is original and what is not- you might as well save yourself the hassle and stop watching these altogether because by these standards youre never going to find a drama that is original. Even if you do find one that seems different on the surface, I assure you it too will have a lot of typicalities in its core. And I say this in the nicest way possible cause been there and done that. So you ask me, Jeana, if they all tell more or less the same story whats the point in watching? So glad you asked. The thing is, while the story may not be entirely never-before seen; the characters that tell the story and the way they tell it, is. And that makes all the difference.Lawless Lawyer, in its core is also a typical crime/law drama and it has all those tropes I just mentioned above. However, the reason why its a must-watch is because it fulfills the goal all dramas strive to achieve: entertainment. And ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you this: LL is entertaining as fucking hell. It has moments that will have you cracking up, moments that will have you hold your breath in suspense even when you can already predict whats going to happen and moments where your heart will fill with pride because of the characters you will surely come to love.Ive been eyeing Lee Joon Gi ever since I saw him single handedly carry the clusterfuck that was Scarlet Heart Ryeo on his beautiful broad shoulders. His acting chops are no joke. You bring him on the screen for two minutes and hell show you he isnt playing. You know how we say that some actors just emote with their eyes? Yeah well, LJG emotes with the very flex of his jaw, the flick of his eyebrow, the tilt of his head- you name the part and the man will show you how to act with it. Simply put, he is brilliant. Which is why its literally a surprise to nobody that Bong Sang Pil is an extremely enigmatic character with madness in his eyes and gold in his heart. It was a joy to watch him and by the end of 16 episodes I was mighty fond of him. Holding her own alongside LJG was our beautiful and talented Seo Ye Ji who first impressed me in Save Me and now won me over in LL. Her character had a solid backbone and she wasnt afraid to show it. I usually have a bone to pick with beautiful actors -both male and female- because they rely heavily on their looks and decide to model their way through the episodes. Even when they are talented, you can see them take it easy and just roll through. I hate that and even my superficial tendency to fawn at pretty faces, masculine abs and collar bones isnt enough to stop me from giving the drama a big fat 4 if I felt like the actor relied more on looks than putting in work. Here however, both LJG and Seo Ji perfectly embodied their characters and did their job despite being two very gorgeous people and that just made watching them extra sweet. Some people say that a show is only as good as its antagonists and worry not my folks because the villains here are also an absolute delight. I have loved Choi Min Soo since his supporting role in Warrior Baek Dong Soo where he stole all the spotlights from his younger and more popular co-stars. Some people think that he tries hard or exaggerates with his roles but I disagree. I feel like he always brings these unique characters to life whose actions you both love and hate. He was an excellent villain in Lawless Lawyer and his Ahn Oh Joo- a greedy, ruthless and power hungry goon made me enjoy every second he was on-screen.Next up on the antagonist list is Nam Soon Jo who with her over-the-top screaming and deliberately evil expressions never failed to amuse me and then finally, last but definitely not the least- weve got Cha Moon Sook played by Lee Hye Young. The evil mastermind and the woman on top of the food chain. She was as cold as they come. As sophisticated as she was cruel and I loved every scene she was in.Lawless Lawyer was a very enjoyable ride from start to finish. There were many endearing supporting characters and some side roles and cameos by older actors who I adore. The music wasnt too extraordinary but it was well-placed throughout the episodes. There wasnt too much of a love story either; as a lot of potentially good chemistry between our leads was left unexplored but Im not complaining because there were some good kisses and cute moments and I dont ask for much in a drama which has romance as a sub-plot only. Other than that, Id say LL had basically a bit of everything- love, laughter, kickass action scenes, suspense and emotion and so baby, I was a happy camper.Yes, there were things that could be better. Some scenes could have developed more properly, some events more fleshed out. The ending more nicely executed but you know what? This show got me out of a three month slump. Before this I kept dropping shows half-way through or near the end cause I just lost interest but with Lawless Lawyer I was compelled to watch episode after episode and I just didnt want it to end.So be brave, give it a shot and delve a little in the land of the lawless. ;)"

I don't normally do daily dramas because there's too much frustration but I decided to give this one a chance but I do regret it though. Don't get me wrong though, there were some strong points in this drama. The pace seemed very good a little before the midway (eps 40-60) of this drama series but it started to get draggy and progression of the story just seemed to stall afterwards, with some progression occasionally. Numerous story plots were revealed, some made sense, others didn't at all. Character wise, Soo Ho was probably the best written character. The other characters were pretty much just a mess going from one end to the other. Not consistent at all and the development just wasn't there for most. Not to mention, this drama also drop a new villain like Ha Young about maybe three quarters of the drama and even during the final 2 weeks of this drama's airing, they introduced a villain who is more powerful than the current villains (who by the way the writers turned good at the very last minute). Talk about the writers not using their episodes wisely, especially since the last episode seemed rushed.Overall, after seeing everything from the plots to the characters, this could've been a great daily drama if it was handled and written better. Some examples:- Ha Young who was introduced I believed around ep 78-80 had a better reason to be a villain than Esther. She should've been introduced to this drama at the beginning not towards the latter half.- Esther shouldn't have been evil at all nor a main character. She should've just been from the start as San Ha's best friend and support. - If the writers wanted to create an all time villain, aka Ha Young's adoptive dad (chairman Oh), who is more powerful, then they should've changed the old villains to good guys a whole lot earlier, along with them realizing what they did was wrong, repented, and served their time for their evil deeds. The writers did such a poor job on this. The villains pretty much gotten away with every evil deed they did. Even if they changed the villains to good the last minute, they still weren't likable and you can tell the writers wanted us to pity these old villains but we don't because of the writers letting the villains getting away unpunished. They lacked the justice for the good guys from start to finish.There are some happy moments but I feel like the frustration this drama gives outweighs the happy scenes/episodes this drama shows."

The story tried so hard to be shocking that characters became cartoonish, and hard to continue to take seriously. Sometimes campy melodramas can be fun for me to watch, but this soon became boring and hard to finish. I expected more of a thriller, based on the first few episodes, but instead got an overdramatic family drama, with unhinged characters and an underwhelming plot.  Maybe some of this has to do with cultural differences, so some of the character's choices made absolutely no sense to me but may resonate better with an actual Korean audience. The cast was pretty good, but I felt like a lot of talent was wasted. Nam Sang Mi and Kim Jae Won had decent chemistry, but the romance story became subdued and even dull once the story focused more on the melodrama. Jae Won played up the smiley nice guy role so much that his portrayal of Dr. Han Gang Woo seemed very one-note and even at times uninteresting to me.  However, it's the character of Ji Eun Han that'supposed to drive this story, and Nam Sang Mi's performance wasn't strong enough for me to do that. Lee Shi Ah's performance felt much more exciting so the shift to a more subdued Nam Sang Mi was a dramatic change. It was almost as if Sang Mi was just too chill to play such an emotionally complicated role. Especially a role where the character has and makes such drastic and contradictory reactions and choices. Also, despite them trying to imply that they were similar, these two actresses were just too drastically different to be considered the same person at all. No plastic surgery in the world is that magical.One talent in particular that felt wasted was Lee Mi Sook, who knows how to make the most out of a melodramatic character, especially this kind of mother role, but her performance felt more interesting than her character was written to be. Detective Kim was similarly underutilized, and the story was less interesting when he was less involved. Jo Hyun Jae was good as well, even when his actions were written in a way that made him more laughable than emotional. Also, Han Eun Jung did her best to play up the drama of her character, as written, but that made her character seem laughingly ridiculous by the end, and hard to take seriously. I also think the cute banter between Jung Jin Woon and Lee Ho Jung is worth mentioning as cute but wasted filler. Many of the minor characters, including the kids, were good even if their character wasn't written well.That takes me to my main issue with this drama, which is the writing. It's not that the story doesn't make sense, but it's sensationalizes everything so much that I couldn't take anything too seriously, or emotionally connect at all.  The drama surrounding a cell phone and a song lasted for so many episodes, which made the story drag. The music was often sinister giving even mundane conversations an extra dramatic feel. It made it seem like they were trying to force a suspenseful feeling at all times, which backfired on me. I did think the ""Save Me"" song was pretty, and although it also felt extra dramatic during certain scenes, was fitting.I'm doubtful I would watch this again, but maybe I would be more forgiving with a second viewing since I now know what the story is really about. My high expectations at the beginning made me more disappointed at what it turned out to be. Lower expectations during a second viewing may make me see this drama differently, and see earlier scenes differently. Maybe it would be less likely to bore me if I binge watched instead of waiting each week for new episodes, which I lost interest in keeping up with.Overall, if you are interested in this drama based on the romantic mystery sounding synopsis, know that this is actually a wealthy family secrets centered melodrama that takes on a serious theme in a very senationalized way. Romance may drive the story, but it isn't the focus, so don't expect that part of the story to be very exciting, especially with two calm and repressed characters. The action feel during the early episodes doesn't last either, and that slowed down the pace for me too. Every question that arises in the story is eventually answered, and there's is a satisfying ending, but I still had a hard time with the pace of the drama, and with the story continuously holding my interest. Don't expect clever twists, even though many parts of the story aren't what they seem to be initially. If you have patience with the story everything pays off, but I'm just not certain that it was worth the price of watching. For a drama about amnesia, it is pretty forgettable."

Non stop thrills from the first episode all the way to the end. Although some of the plots were cliche and I was able guess the who is the killer and the ending, it was still intriguing to watch every episode.2. So many memorable characters. Jimin should be crowned as father of the year. And the Evil mom in law as the worst EMIL!! Also loved Woo Joo - she reminds me so much of a younger Kim Yoo Jung.3. No filler episodes, every scene was jampacked with details and information. The soundtrack was on point. I thought that classical music BGM from AWOTM was scary but every time I hear that violin sounds i just know something bad will happen to Eunsu.4. Lessons learned - hell hath no fury like a ""mother"" scorned. The lengths parents go to to protect their family. And even at your darkest point, you can get up and move forward, and find someone who will accept and love you as you are.Dislikes:The weakest link is Semi. She was annoying for the entire show, doing nothing but put her anger and blame on Eunsu without taking a look at herself.Rating: 9.5/10"

The climax intensified when Main FL & her husband collaborated to kill the Second FL but Main FL ended up killing her own husband and take all the blame upon herself. The mind boggling plot twists in Ep7&8 had me on the edge of my seat, thoroughly engrossed in the story.The performances in the drama were brilliant. Everyone, from Seung Jae (FL's son) to the supporting characters like the neighbor lady, delivered their best. However, I must commend Lim Ji Yeon for stealing the spotlight with her incredible performance as the Second FL. She portrayed the character brilliantly.The writing & direction were excellent. I appreciated the small details & nuances in the writing, & dialogues were impactful, especially during the confrontation between the second FL & first FL in Ep 7.The cinematography perfectly captured the dark & thrilling nature of the story. The use of black and white color grading during the scene of the second FL killing her husband was particularly effective.Bgms added another layer to the overall experience, enhancing the suspense & tension of the dark thriller."

At least not online.Episode 1, was about her lies. She created  a whole new person by using one photo. my personal views are on this is, first that girl is stupid. why do you need to create a boyfriend? I mean I know it's hard to find a nice guy but girl! you need to respect yourself.  Secondly, you don't need to prove anyone that you have rocking life, you can still prove it without having a boyfriend.Episode 2, When he offered her to be her real boyfriend for like one day. If I was that girl I would have slapped him across his face and no comments for kiss cause it's really boiled my blood.Episode 3, they went on real date. That was cute and cheesy.Episode 4, everything was crushed. when they went on ""high trip"" (you know what I mean), I thought that he likes her but no, he was a total jerk. Though he revealed everything online, it must be really hard for the girl but I can't say that it was guy's fault cause she do used his picture without asking him.Conclusion: story is nice and simple, acting is a bit off. It's kinda like moral values-based story.(And I sorry if anyone find it offending.)"

This was refreshing. It just jumped right into it. You quickly realize there will be no hand-holding and very little leading. Different. That's how I would describe the experience of watching this. It was a serious drama. Not in the way of intense romance, love triangles, physical fights, or big twists though. In fact, I didn't feel as if they shoe-horned in anything unnecessarily. I wasn't able to point out anything that was added in to drag out the runtime. It uses its time to seriously show the difficulty/horror of being a health care worker and the challenges and in-fights between hospital owners and staff, as well as carefully thread a message that becomes clear only at the end.What sticks with me even now is the uncomfortableness they managed to make me feel by showing the ""bad guy"" show some humanity. I felt this ""wrongness"" from it, as if he didn't have the right to. But that is how people are. They aren't as easy to categorize into good and evil as we would like them to be.And, the message. The ending isn't satisfying. It doesn't have a true ""conclusion"" as it were. It seems to say, ""This is what life is."" You get by, you face a fight, you manage to get your head above water, you find something to brighten your day, and the cycle repeats. One stumbling block is dealt with, only for another to come down the road. We struggle and we smile, alone and with others.

But if you look past the constant yelling, outbursts of rage and fighting you will find some pretty sweet volnarable and lovable human beings... The story is interesting, confusing in a good way and keeps you (kept me) on your toes for the most part. The characters are complex and the line between dream/reality good/evil are very blurry which is something I personally really appreciate. Officer Yoon, the one female officer is really cool she is smart, funny, bit too emotional and shows a very subtle way trying to make her mark without becoming macho herself...  in a macho environment. We also get to see more or less subtle acts of sexism and harassment who cater to my personal prejedus of how it was to be a woman in the police force in the 80s. It also showed how little a man had to do to seem dreamy and make a girl feel respected (basic human curtesy). Subtle but very real portrayals of day to day seism in the work force. Her acting however seemed a bit off, but it could be her role too. The friendships and bonds made here are definitely a good point, as well as the mystery but the best  and most scary part is still the blurr... But a lot was ruined by the yelling and my constant wish to send them all (yes all) to therapy to work on handling their emotional issues. Definitely a decent watch, just mind the yelling and emotional reactions."

Dont expect this show to change your life, but it might leave you with some thoughts to think about. Its a short story of finding yourself, standing up for your beliefs, improving and changing your environment. At first all the characters might seem stereotypical, but there is more to them. Tae Kyung is not your typical introverted shy boy. While he might not be the life of the party, he is confident and honest, never scared of voicing his opinion to the people he cares about. Shin Woo seems like a cold, distant lead? Could not be further from the truth. He is a shy, sweet and loving potato that needs some time to open up to other people. He values his friends, trying to stay honorable while not giving up on what he desires and loves. Da On might seem too good to be true, but he is battling his own demons. The external and internal pressure to be a perfect student, friend, son took a toll on him, and we witness his slow change, as he discovers who he truly is. Shi Woon is not just a comedic relief that is supposed to brighten up the mood. He is the most caring and emotionally mature of all the characters, always giving wise advice and making sure everyone is taken care of. While the drama follows all the well known tropes, by changing some details, and giving the character more nuance, it becomes more interesting and engaging. The love triangle? Chefs kiss. The way the story unfolds, you cannot stop yourself from understanding both main ships, since they both work and have their charming aspects. The acting could be improved. I know many people say Tae Kyung is just that awkward character, hence the acting is fitting - for me its just not good. While I ended up liking the awkwardness behind Sae Ons line delivery (it was cute), I do think he needs to train his acting skills quite a bit. The rest of the cast did rather well. Some more emotional scenes from Seo Hyun seemed a bit empty, but So Hees character was not worth even caring about, so I let it pass.Light On Me is an amazing step forward for Korean BLs. The audience wants a longer format, the audience wants better production quality and the audience will appreciate the hard work. This show proves it. While I dont think its the best K-BL, I completely understand the sentiment of people who do believe so. With more and longer episodes, the main leads were fleshed out more, the story had a steady pace and the supporting characters were more than just extras filling the space. I also have to appreciate the job done behind the scenes - the cast supporting the genre in the interviews. The whole production team seemed to do it for more than just money, there is a true important message they are trying to convey. Even the OST singers A.C.E showed support for the community on countless occasions. On the OST - opening song is such a bop. Some complaints though. While I understand the purpose of So Hees character, I also believe the show could have done without her being the antagonist. The same result could have been achieved without making the only female character the ""villain"". Her character progression was also not quite believable. Another small, but extremely distracting aspect was the makeup. Damn. What theyve done to Sae Ons pretty face should land them in jail. It was extremely unnatural, which added to the robotic vibe Tae Kyung gave because of the, at times questionable line delivery. They literally looked like plastic dolls, with white faces not quite fitting the tone of the neck. The last thing worth mentioning - the first episode does not represent the drama well. It was not the best introduction to the story and the characters, but I promise it gets better with each episode. Overall, such a fun and enjoyable ride. It truly brought a lot of people on mdl together to discuss the characters and relationships. Getting so many people so attached and engaged speaks volumes about the show itself."

Sometimes shows drag a few episodes but I've become tired at how slow this show has been moving. I've been watching it at 1.25x or 1.5x speed because the show is about to complete and it's dragging. It feels like there wasn't much of a story to begin with so what could have been completed in 10 episodes was stretched out to 16. The earlier episodes of the show were enjoyable but you slowly start to get fed up and just wish the characters would tell each other what's going on. By the 14th episode,  you are just waiting for things to be done already because you've lost hope in anything redeemable in the plot.As far as acting goes, the male lead  has only been able to express concern and sadness and the rest of the time he is straight-faced whereas the actress had to play a clueless bunny who weeps frequently. Not the actors fault for having to portray such characters.Spoiler:If they had established that the sister was dead and they just needed to find out what happened to her, I would feel less frustrated with this story. And the chef has not been able to open up his restaurant until the 15th episode which just adds to the madness.  I had hoped that the ending might be able to redeem itself but alas, it continued to drag. One final question remains. Why? What was the motive? It is never explained. It seems like no one was interested in finding out if there were more possible victims. Everything else just seems like an attempt at rescuing this show but there's not much they could do at this point.High expectations.

I was hooked from the first episode and watched until the end as the story was interesting, several of my favourite actresses were in it and I liked the general vibe. It was mysterious with all the orchid business, you could easily empathise with the three sisters, with some more and some less though - and tension built up nicely for the final episodes. There where some storyline weaknesses before but I was able to ignore them, sadly not so in the final episode.So whatever happened then? Was this another drama that was short cut from 16 to 12 episodes? Was there not enough time left to write a good final episode? This final episode had severe logic weaknesses and they were just left unsolved to give the show some kind of happy end.So what bothered me was: 1. So what was all that satisfactory scene when reporter Oh In-Kyung could finally prove that Won Sang-A is a devilsih murderder? She has CCTV matierial showing Won Sang-A brutally mudering a person. And after that? No police goes immediately to arrest Won Sang-A, instead she can joyfully go to the hospital and kill that old man who gave her away, in front of a nurse witnessing this? Still no police. Time passes and she then has time to stage all that final scene under the orchid tree in her cellar. Still no one arresting her while the incriminating material of her being a murderer was on live TV probably two days earlier?So she can manage to abduct Jin Hwa-Young, and lure Oh In-joo into that cellar too, still no police at her house arresting her?That was so nonsensical and made that reporting and proof of Oh In Kyung totally useless. 2. So Won Sang-A then had enough time to prepare the sprinklers with acid. Ok. So she turns on the sprinklers and the acid dircetly hits Jin Hwa-Young being bound to that chair, and the pure acid drops hit her for quite some time, she is screaming on and on, but nothing really happens to her, she is not really hurt by the pure acid drops. Then in a twist of actions Won Sang-A falls into the pond under the orchid tree and - suddenly burns completely in huge blisters from the acid? How?If the pure drops of acid did not harm Jin Hwa-Young for quite some time, why would the water, only containing a few drops of acid totally burn Won Sang-A if she falls in there? That was even more nonsensical as nothing would have happened to Won Sang-A falling into that pond, it would just have been water with acid so thinned out that nothing would have happened to her.3. I'm always in for a happy end but also that was questionable. So the youngest sister gives a lot of money to her older sisters out of gratitude. That is a nice gesture and I would have loved to just see it as that. But, Oh In-Joo was just convicted with serious money matters and is on probation for the next years. Does anyone really think the authorities would not check on her if she suddenly had 23 million Dollars in her account? No way would they have left her untouched and the whole trouble would have begun again, her youngest sister then being a suspect and internationally sought for. Also the two young girls were travelling with their real passports and real names, it would be very easy to track them down as long as they wouldn't have fake identities.  (and they didn't as Park Hyo-rin needed to use her real name to achive all that money at her becoming aif age)4. And what happened to Go Su-Im? Is she also still roaming free? If so, wouldn't she try to harm the three sisters still? I found this to be such a good show until this final episode which seemed hushed and not thought through. The focus was on creating this final scene under the orchid tree without considering the rest of the before given circumstances and the fact that Won Sang-A would never have had the chance to do all that because shortly after the live TV airing of her mudering someone the police would have taken her.So, this annoyed me so much  that my rating weng down from 8,5 to 7.0.I wish the producers of the dramas could manage to not hush the last episode and storyline like that (and it's not the first time this is happening) for the sake of logic and common sense that totally goes overboard in this final episode here."

Especially since it was done as a 'slice of life' style rather than action. I had mixed emotions while watching this show, as someone that works in the law enforcement sector, it hit close to home and sometimes felt all too real. I cheered for the officer's victories, sympathized with their losses, and burned in frustration or anger with their hardships as officers. It was an emotionally full show. Lt. Oh Yang Chon and his wife, Jang Mi were my favorite characters in the show - I would have been perfectly happy if they had been the only two leads. Sang Soo and Jung Oh triggered irritation in me many times, but that could have been their purpose as they experienced their character growth from civilians that needed a steady paycheck, to recruits, to rookies in their field training period. I'm not a Lee Kwang Soo fan, so I didn't go into this drama for him as an actor. He overacted a bit in places, but otherwise, he did a fair job playing Sang Soo, which is a departure I believe from his usual comedic roles.  I think I was more disappointed in Sang Soo as a character than Kwang Soo as an actor. I do generally like Jung Yoo Mi, and she did a good job in her role, but Jung Oh was also a character I didn't really connect with much or feel much empathy for. She just was. The real standouts for me were Bae Sung Woo as Lt. Oh Yang Chon and Bae Jong Ok as his wife, Captain Ahn Jang Mi. Their marriage and careers were much more interesting and layered than the rookie officers. They are the characters that I related to and cared for. I enjoyed the side characters and they did an excellent job playing their roles. There were many interesting facets to the story.The officers in this show are often between a rock and a hard place. I feel for them tremendously if this is really how the system is in S. Korea. Of course, some of the things are reminiscent of the way things have been going in the U.S. for the past several years. They are paid pitifully little to put their lives on the line every day, not knowing whether they will make it home safely. They put themselves in harm's way to catch a criminal only to be accused of 'brutality' when the suspect is apprehended. If they are injured themselves, then they are just abandoned to take care of it themselves. In the heat of the moment when it's a choice between taking action or being a 'coward', they can't win. The public cries out that they went too far if use of force is involved and if they don't catch the criminal (possibly being too scared of disciplinary action to take extraordinary measures) they are accused of not doing their duty and wasting taxpayers money. They are the ones that get cursed at and spit on and accused of wrong-doing just for doing their job. And their superiors can't be counted on to have their backs. Who could continue to have a 'sense of duty' in such a landmine of a job? Thank goodness they can at least count on those that are out in the field with them (for the most part) to have some measure of loyalty and support. Why would anyone want to take on a role as an officer when this is the kind of thanks they receive for protecting the public? It really makes you think about their role in society and who will even want to do this kind of job in the future. It also raises questions of how 'social media justice' plays a part in ruining people's livelihoods - there is no repentance in the age of internet. Your wrongdoings will haunt you forever - following you until the day you die. It made me very aware of the reason that the suicide rates in S. Korea are so high. The music was wonderful and fit the tone of the show well. They had a couple of English OST's - one being Carry Me by Family of the Year, the same group that sang the song ""Hero"", the OST from It's Okay That's Love (coincidentally, also featuring Lee Kwang Soo). The other song I liked was In Your Light by Jon Allen. I wouldn't re-watch this just due to the sheer length - 18 episodes running at about an hour and twenty minutes each. All in all, this was a powerful show and worth the time to watch, though."

I wasn't able to suspend disbelief that far.  She was cold, and mean throughout most of the show.  I might have been able to forgive that from a secondary character, but not from the main character.  I don't like mean girls and that was the focus here.I thought that the ML was mis-written as well.  He didn't look or act like a teenager, at all.  He acted more like a teacher, so I had a hard time with connections between him and all the other characters.To be honest, the reason I didn't rate this lower was because of the secondary characters.  They were very enjoyable to watch.  The secondary couple was cute, though their big break up made no sense, other than to serve to drive the story forward.  I especially loved watching the third ""couple"" - Kim Yoo-Shin was bubbly, positive and spent most of his time following Ji So-hyun around.  He was very outspoken about the fact that he liked So-hyun, but he was such a likeable character I found myself rooting for him.I'm not a big person on revenge; however, I felt that with the seriousness of the topic that was the focus of the show, the perpetrators should have been dealt with more severely.This drama had the advantage of being only eight episodes.

This sprinkles a lot of color over the topic and opens up a perspective that does not have to polarize. This rapprochement is rounded off by the enchanting development of the relationship between the protagonists - the modern day surgeon in modern Seoul and Heo-im from Joseon days, who get emotionally involved over the course of the story, although their personalities could not be more different.""Live up to your name"" juxtaposes modern surgery & medical technology  as well as traditional Korean medicine, which is recently becoming more and more popular in the increasing medical tourism in South Korea. In this context, the audience is introduced to a luminary of traditional Korean medicine who made a considerable contribution to acupuncture in his time (16th century) - Heo-im. The KDrama guarantees an entertaining and lively excursion into some background knowledge about attitude, methods and possibilities of traditional medicine.Just seeing Kim Nam-gil as Heo-im is worth watching this KDrama. He does an excellent job of portraying the ambivalent personality: there is the simple man from a poor background, whom he would like to escape at any price, and there is the ingenious healer with almost spiritual talent. Sometimes it's quite funny and then again heartwarming and profoundly serious with confident lightness. In addition, there are the traditional healing methods, the virtuosity in handling the acupuncture needles and the feeling for the flow of energy... this can not only be experienced with the example of Heo-im, but also with the other representatives of traditional Korean medicine. There is also room for dealing with those for whom traditional medicine is mainly a business today - a service that can be sold very well in South Korea these days, especially with a VIP upgrade as a trendy, exotic treatment method in the context of medical tourism. There are the VENDORS of traditional Korean medicine and there are the HEALERS of traditional methods. And then there is modern medicine and the growing market of the health industry. Eventually, what makes the difference (and also offers the common ground between paradigms) are the attitude, dedication and mission when it comes to healing... ------ SIDE NOTE: --- Historical Heo-im (1570-1647)---His reputation as an acupuncturist preceded the historical Heo-im of his time - not only in the Joseon Dynasty itself, but as far away as China and Japan. Originally he was of humble origin, but due to his incredible achievements in medicine he became the personal physician at the royal court and a government official at the age of 30. During the Japan War, he was able to further expand his reputation through his gifted achievements in acupuncture. However, the nobles rejected him as their equal and excluded him, so that he returned to his village at the age of about 50 and practiced his healing art on the common people there until he died at the age of 77. In recent years he has written a large, well-regarded work, the ChimGuGyungHumBang (book on acupuncture and moxibustion). In it he describes his methods of pain management and procedures in which acupuncture points are not (only) stimulated by needle sticks, but also by heat.-----------------------------------------------"

Maybe it's his way to act on the character or maybe he really didn't grasp the concept, I'm not sure, but sometimes idols who tend to try the acting path find trouble doing soOn a second note this was only a 2 episode special, for me this concept would have worked better if it had been more explored with a couple more episodes, because there were definitely parts that needed closure and the end scene was just plain unecessary, if you ask me... maybe if they would make it with a different approach or an if Also it felt rushed and lacking the right emotions in a certain way, if this was intended to have an angst approach it didn't hit me at all,  but that might just be me, that had higher expetactions  towards itStory wise, I really find the theme interesting the whole value time before it's too late and finding our yesterdays and making them count, it's a moving concept that can be covered in many ways, again this was a short dorama, more like a movie in time wise that wasn't really well managed, leaving certain aspects lacking and other's overly used, for example: (MAYBE A SPOILER) the time  lapse it happened on his loss time... like maybe it's just me but if I only had a certain ammount of time to solve my things, I wouldn't waste it at all, I would like to make it count, every single minuteIn acting it was so so, the male lead soothing voice and poker expressions, might be part of the character but he could have built better emotional wise on the parts where he could show more, I mean where is the despair of the injustice he is facing all ALONE? Where is the denial, maybe in 5 stages? Where is the raw need of reaching, and running wild trying to fix everything because of his mistakes and poorly attitude towards his life, the female lead was somehow ok but also being a short dorama it could have built more, I found the acting of the Judo school champ way better in a certain wayFor music, I wasn't that really tunned with it to be honnest, which only means it didn't move me, and blended well with the scenes and surroundings, or maybe I was lost into the story expecting it to get better Overall it's a nice 2 episodes that one can see, although there's many lacking loop holes there, it's definitely not the worse I've ever seen.... If I would ever watch it again, maybe after some time trying to remember if I ever watched it, but I would probably still have the same view of it: It's OK but it could be BETTERHope this helps x'D it's my first time trying a review here, so I tried to avoid major spoilers ^^'PS: sorry if I made any mistakes, trying my best in english :)"

A true feel lost, feel sad, feel real... Without hope and unnecessary positiveness. The drama started of a bit weak, but wheeled me in and actually did manage to touch every part of your soul with its imperfections, portrayals of depression, loss and relationships. It also had me wanting to strangle the mother in law over, and over again  letting me feel the aggravation as a contrast to the rest of the characters who where mostly  lovable, complex, interesting , no one was perfect, no one was pure good, all made mistakes. though I may not always agree with the characters dissuasions I could clearly understand what lead them to make the choices they made.  I honestly fell in love with the way this drama portrayed all these different perspectives with stories that need to be told.  Ironically enough this drama feels honest in a way though it portrays a whole web of lies and secrets that have been kept for a very long time. I can not stress enough the slightly subtle but realistic and important portrayals of domestic abuse, depression, power abuse, power relations, poverty, and all round issues that effect women, elderly and the less wealthy  in  modern society. Though the mother in law brought out my violent side the way she talked about her daughter in law was extremely spot on, full of prejudice and blaming her for her situation. The way the father portrays hid deteriorating health, while trying to stay strong is just heart wrenching. I loved the conversations he had with his daughter as well as seeing him interact with the people around him. The husbands first love almost double life, was also really well done, sometimes I hated  her some times I loved her but most importantly I could relate to her and really appreciated  the way she showed the perspective of a loved one slowly watching someone disappear, saying something like: To others it may seem like he is just  lying there, but  there are days when he smiles more,he gets sad when something bad happens in the ward...  'I also got a full blown crush on  Ryu Joon Yeols character, the way he handled the situations around him, I loved all the bits where we got to hear his voice telling us his inner thoughts and then seeing what is shown to the outside. This guy was very subtle and good at reading the room and though he was not the typical male lead. He does have a charm  it was hard not to fall for him, and that beautiful smile.  There is also something special about the way this drama portrays intimacy, with extreme attention to detail.Somehow even simple situations could get really intense and had my heart race... So to sum it up this is may not be a feel good drama, but it is beautiful, intense and  is sure to make you feel things..."

To me, its a depiction of the current social environment around us. Not the most appealing, but never the less, its there, and weve all seen it. Infidelity is a dirty word to one person and a taste of freedom to another. I think this series tells us that we all view relationships differently. Our thoughts, needs, and values are different. We even view love differently. The story I watched for sixteen episodes was a bitter look into the world of betrayal. It shows us how people justify their actions when faced with diversity in a relationship. It also shows us how fragile marriage can be when you dont nurture it. It shows us how hateful and desperate people can be. It also shows us the ugly head of temptation. I think this series took a lot of thought and work to put together. It was a raw look at the emotional struggles of human beings trying to survive in a world that pulls them apart.I thought the acting was perfect. There were two standouts for me. Lee Ga Ryongs portrayal of Hye Ryung was just fantastic. Playing this type of character and making it seem real is not easy. Another one of my favorite parts was in episode 7 when Hyang Gi (Jeon Hye Won) told her dad what she thought about him divorcing her mom in no uncertain terms. She said everything her mom wanted to say, and it was priceless. Hye Won shined in this supporting role, and it left me with a favorable impression of her acting skills.The music pulled everything together, and the subscripts were great. I enjoyed this because it was different. Is it worth watching? Cudos to Im Sung Han for her screenwriting and to Yoo Jung Joon for directing a masterpiece."

(Source: Netflix) ,"Jeon Noh Min, Jeon Soo Kyung, Lee Ga Ryeong, Lee Tae Gon, Park Joo Mi, Sung Hoon",Netflix TV Chosun,"Not Looking Forward To A Season 3  An entire episode during season 2 of 'Love (ft. Marriage and Divorce)' was dedicated to a husband making extremely weak attempts to justify his cheating on his wife to his wife which he ultimately failed to do.  And I thought to myself, ""What a waste of an episode"" but it's to be expected from a Kdrama that dresses up the trauma and pain of adultery in the latest fashions and then tries to convince us that we should have some sort of empathy for the cheaters.I would've liked to have seen during season 2 of 'L(fMaD)' how the wives would've been treated if they were the ones cheating. I'm sure they all would've been slut-shamed for starters and the radio show would've most definitely been canceled. Season 2 like season 1 also misses opportunities to confront the false notion that women only have value as wives and mothers. Instead, 'L(fMaD)' season 2 reinforces it. But, then again, this is the same country where male netizens criticized a South Korean Olympic gold medalist An San for having short hair.I wanted to punch the husband who impregnated the older woman in the throat. At no time was I convinced that he was a lawyer acting that childish. I'm glad his wife beat his ass. He was one of the most annoying characters in a Kdrama I've ever seen...and I've watched Strong Woman Do Bong Soon.  And his parents cosigning his cheating was just irritating.I almost threw up when one of the wives excuses her husband's infidelity by saying that she must have been a bad person in a past life. Huh?And the season 2 finale did not make me want to stick around for a season 3 even though I know I will continue to hate-watch this Kdrama."

What I didn't like about this series:-Which century is the series living in?  The Scarlett Letter comes to mind.  Massive punishment for the transgressors makes sense if this were the 15th century or earlier-Melodramatic acting (over exaggerated) on the part of some of the actors-The constant repeatings of previous scenes to the point where I didn't know if  were watching the present or not-The final episode which was clearly rushed and fill-in.  Writer could have spent more time on the main couple in their final scene.  A brief smile between the 2 leads is not enough_The annoying repeating apologies ""I'm so sorry"" and the constant apologetic kneelings on the part of the transgressorsWould I have watched this If I knew how bad certain aspects of this drama were?

It turned out to be nothing like what I'd expected, and to be honest it was kind of a hot mess. AND YET, it was addictive and I felt anxious watching it.It's messy because it basically threw all the cliches into a pot and used all of themrich man/poor girl, best friend love triangle, characters screaming their emotions into the void, backstabbing best friend, Cinderella's step-family...but the way they did it was completely unexpected and not in the order you'd expect.I was really annoyed with all the characters' actions right off the bat: Jo-Jo for being a cheater, Sun-Oh for stabbing his friend in the back, and Hye-Young for being a creepy stalker. I felt like people were only rooting for him because they saw his perspective, but from Jo-Jo's point of view, he barely even talked to her and just creepily followed her everywhere.Because of all the characters' immature personalities, for once I felt like the time skip was in the right place. And as someone who usually DETESTS all time jumps, I really liked how it was inserted, and how the characters changed during that time. I do hate that noble idiocy is such a huge plot point, but the fact that it took place in the time skip made it a bit better, even though I still found myself frustrated with the flashback scenes.The time skip was also helpful in getting me to not hate Hye-Young, because I liked his character development and how he finally took action, instead of always looking from afar. Even though his character is growing on me though, I still definitely have second lead syndrome and am rooting for Sun-Oh.The cinematography and visual effects were the best part of this entire thing. I loved the sound effects. how the app looks, how everything was filmed, and how the 10m radius is edited. EVERYTHING.I really wish there was more sismance and bromance. The bromance was nice, even though it crashed and burned near the end. On the other hand, there was ZERO sismance, and I hated how all the female characters (other than Kim Jo-Jo) were portrayed as boy-obsessed, shallow, gossipy, etc. Honestly, Jo-Jo's minor scenes with her wedding work friend were so refreshingand more friendship is needed in this entire drama, which would work out to balance all the romance drama.Because it was so romance heavy, I also found myself loving the scenes that delved into more Black Mirror territory and talked about heavier topics, like the protests, exploitation, suicides, etc. I really wished that that was a bigger part of the story, because there's a lot of potential for the characters to get involved in more than the melodrama cliches.I also appreciate the lowkey LGBT mentions and how it's addressed with ""It's not like you can control your feelings.""

Love Alarm Season 2,,,9210,2021.0,2021.0,6,,,,"Longing for resounding proof of her feelings, Kim Jo Jo sets out to uninstall the shield and make the app ring for her one true love.(Source: Netflix) ","Go Min Si, Jung Ga Ram, Kim Si Eun, Kim So Hyun, Shim Yi Young, Song Kang",Netflix,"Did Love Alarm Season 2 Ring Another   Alarm Bell  For Bad Story-writing?  With a nearly two year gap between season 1 and 2,  an additional director Kim Jin Woo onboard, anticipation from drama fans about the fate of Jo Jo ( Kim So Hyun)s love life, and high expectations about the overall production value , it may surprise a lot of reviewers scrolling through some of the top reviews, how many fans have scored the drama with adequate ratings. Some of these comments tend to argue along the same ineffable and biased  notions that it was a  bad ending and  not as good as season 1, however, how does the story actually play out through an objective criticism   in terms of characterisation, coherency and storyline in season 2?   Love Alarm Season 2 picks itself up during the initial time-skip of season 1, with previously  high school characters now ensuing careers or studies; Jo Jo is a university major, her current  complicated  boyfriend Lee Hye Young ( Jung Ga Ram) works as a technician at JoAlarm ( the development company for  Love Alarm)  and former flame Hwang Sun Oh ( Song Kang) is becoming a famous national model and endorser for the app, however, Jo Jo has been hiding a secret about her app that allowed her to cut off the signal in order to inhibit her true feelings from Hye Young and Sun Oh . With the desire to reveal her feelings again, Jo Jo decides to pursue the  mysterious Brian Cheon in order to unlock this feature.   Before addressing anything about the show, it is probably most prominent to point out the confusing chronology at times within the opening of season 2, by not initially  leaving off from the cliffhanger of season 1. Although it is understandable that a wide gap between seasons could have left viewers a little cloudy upon events and thus starting on a different storyline wasnt  too illogical, it was a little head-scratching that screenwriters Lee Ah Yeon and Lee Na Jung didnt attempt to even address or explain this suddenly  different storyline from season 1s ending. This naturally left a massive hole within story development, not least for our main trio and their previously poorly-tackled characterisation from the past season.Kim So Hyun wasnt entirely  unwatchable  within her role as Jo Jo, but her performance did feel a little lacklustre due to general line deliverances. In terms of Jo Jos character development, there were a couple of more notable  traits for Jo Jo than her season 1 counterpart , by actually acting out upon her emotions rather than remaining  obliviously unaware as well as a fairly traumatic backstory. On the other hand, Jo Jo still failed from breaking   her initial mould as the  prosaic heroine of the series due to the same ridiculously staid personality  traits imposed onto the character by screenwriters Lee Ah Yeon and Lee Na Jung. The most evident example of this being   Jo Jos  complicated feelings between Hye-Yeong and Sun Oh, which whilst evidently used to  heighten the tension of Jo Jos love life, still seemed fairly cruel  by Jo Jos similar indecisiveness as the first season at times, by  not forthright addressing  her affections rather than leading on both male leads in such an immature manner . ( This is advocated by a later plot development which proves Jo Jos true nature.) It is important to address this factor of immaturity,  due to the evident age difference from different seasons often allowing a character to develop and mature as a consequence of their experiences. Instead, Jo Jo seemed to make the same mistakes as her past self by making ridiculously stupid decisions questioning how on earth she lived so long, let alone pass her exams to get into university. This is exemplified  in  an early scene of the series when she is working at the convenience store and hears a  love alarm go off and her stalkers uncomfortable actions towards her, Jo Jos first thought  is to walk home by herself, talk to her stalker and then proceed to run away without thinking to call the police or at least her friend Mon Soon ( Bae Da Bin) in order to ensure the same thing doesnt happen again. Whilst this scene was used to  drive tension, it did seem to gloss over the uglier possibility of what could have happened to Jo Jo as a consequence of her stupidity in reality as well as the more  romanticised tones of emotional and physical abuse appearing in the series. This naturally draws us onto the biggest elephant in the room since season 1, the continuously brooding ( and  preferred love interest by many devoted fans of the series )  Sun Oh. Similar to his costar, Song Kang is a fairly good actor, however, his performance consisted mainly between  stoic, constipated expressions  and  furious yelling for a major proportion of the series.Arguably there were some better insights than season 1 into Sun Ohs fairly estranged  relationship with his mother Jung Mi Mi ( Song Sun Mi) and his unhappy family life, however, rather than screenwriters allowing this to gradually mature or allow  Sun Oh to develop from  his inferiority complex in season one, his personality is still written off as fractious, immature and egotistical within his portrayal in season 2 by often storming off, breaking things and hurting others in the procedure. In particular, this is seen through how Sun Oh interacts emotionlessly his  girlfriend Yook Jo ( Kim Shi Eun) and often manipulating  her overt feelings towards him, as well as his interactions with Jo Jo. With his unrequited love towards Jo Jo since high school becomes the main highlight of their  possible pairing for many fans and whilst it is understandable why Sun Oh felt anger or upset towards Jo Jo not replicating her feelings, it does not excuse some of his terrible actions towards our female lead. Sun Ohs actions of publicly embarrassing Jo Jo in front or her classmates , kissing her without permission whilst she is respectfully dating Hye-Hyeong and then throwing another temper tantrum by flaring up in Hye Hyeongs face without accepting or apologising for his mistakes , made him an incredibly difficult individual to truly romantically pair with Jo Jo by his lack of respect towards her feelings ( and  his former best friend Hye Young).This naturally draws us to the lovelorn Lee Hye Young, who viewers are made aware early on in the series that he  is aware of Jo Jos ambiguous  feelings towards him in their relationship , yet nevertheless does not force or implicate Jo Jo to give him an answer. Whilst Hye Young remained the most respectful towards Jo Jo as an individual and as a love interest, his obsequious beliefs that   one day she will love me too seemed a little questionable towards Hye-Youngs fairly hot pursuit of his own  feelings towards Jo Jo in in season 1. Consequently, the introduced relationship between the two characters felt more  obliged in order to keep the   storyline moving , than intricately complicated as it should have been with Jo Jos feelings.  In addition to this, there still remained many unanswered questions towards how Hye-Young landed a job at the company as well as more realistic insight into his qualifications at work whilst presumably not in full-education. Perhaps the one actual interesting element of the second season remained within the mysterious appearance of Brian Cheon (  Ki Do Hoon) who makes  the characters ( most notably Jo Jo) wonder if he is actually their  dead classmate and seemingly former developer Duk Gu. Whilst this is an overarching storyline in parts of the episode, the ending result felt incredibly letdown and lacklustre  by lacking development or screen time as well as wider development for second female lead Park Gul Mi( Go Min Si), rather than in favour of the heroines questionable romantic pairings. As a consequence, the  pacing of the show felt oddly imbalanced between moments of genuine interesting development, and dragging scenes of puppy dog eyes by Hye Young and Sun Oh towards Jo Jo from a distance creating many notable plot inconsistencies . The ending of the series was more a matter of opinion that particularly  bad or  good. Diehard fans who havent really acknowledged the direction of the plot, may feel disappointment, yet whilst still undeniably  half-baked in comparison to the initial premise introduced in the show back in season 1, it was not an entirely dire ending for the show as well .Ultimately,  Love Alarm Season 2 did initiate more mature themes and backstories behind our characters, however, lacking character development, inconsistencies, a coherent and riveting plot line in a fictionalised reality and rushed development in parts, made the second season feel more like a surreal dream phase, than a coherent and complete finale for  Love Alarm."

I wanted KJH to be exposed for exposing Park Ji Wan's traumaand worse of all I wanted Kang Chae Ri to show the hidden scenes between Goo Yu Reum  and Park Jae Hoon, because she was the evil editing that used people for viewership... so what was the point in everyone snooping? that 1 small ""scandal""? where's the big shocking finale?also I loved Ahn So Yeon but the heck was her ending too? the guy cheated on her. sure they weren't official, but he slept with someone else while he faked being fully invested in herPark Ji Wan and John Jang were the only good thing out of this but even their interest in one another should've been exposed..  in the end everyone was happy, like non of the conflicts mattered... no one followed through with their evil intentions... tbh the last eps were a disappointmentit's one of those cases a writer has an idea, and thinks ""inspiration"" comes after filming ep per ep and then boom it's the ending and nothing is coherent"

A leader at So What Media, Lee Joon’s content production team is one of the company’s best but by demanding the best from his team, he’s developed a reputation as the company’s toughest team leader. Seen by all as an iron-clad man who’s set in his ways, everyone is surprised when it becomes apparent that the company’s new employee, Jeong Ha Ram, has started to get under his skin.A very straightforward type of person, Ha Ram hides nothing about himself, including his sincere beliefs about love. Skeptical of love himself, Lee Joon has a hard time understanding how Ha Ram can be so open about love. Even more confusing for Lee Joon is trying to understand the feelings that he seems to be developing for the company’s newest employee. Finding themselves in a bit of a push-and-pull relationship, Lee Joon and Ha Ram begin to understand each other better, as they slowly learn about each other’s past and present struggles.

Love On Green,,,56689,2022.0,2022.0,8,,,,,"Kang Min Woo, Kim Hyun Mok, Kim Kyung Hwan, Moon Woo Bin, Seo Ji Soo",,"Kinda boring, but it does have a few things going for it.   Perhaps I was a little too optimistic when I found this. I mean, if you know me, you know how much I love the sports genre in dramaland. Love On Green necessarily isn't bad, it has many of the right ingredients in the recipe to produce something tasty and memorable. Good production value, good OST, good cast. However, it also lacks the basic fundamentals such as a good story, good characters and good script. I think the biggest reason for this was the length of the episodes, some were hovering around the five-minute mark. So, in that short space of time, I had imagined much more action, especially around the sport: golf, and the golf competition. In terms of the amount of sport coverage however, I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, the focus on romance was a little too much at points, but it showed enough golf to leave me satisfied. I was happy that scenes regarding golf were done in different ways: such as the different types of gold played. Screen golf, golf via practicing at a driving range, and then playing 'proper' golf as I like to put it. I also liked the golf-related scenes in the office environment which I always think is needed in this genre (instead of working at work, playing sports when playing sports - obviously I understand why this is done, but this is dramaland, not real life!). Do I recommend this? It's not a definite yes, but if you like watching short episodes at roughly 4 to 8 minutes long, then I think you would like this."

Also the drama has awesome secondary leads in Yeon Ji and Jason. No bitchiness or suffocating love. They are so good that you wished their arc is a happy and fulfilling one too. The characters and story backdrop is sufficiently thick that it could easily be a longer drama and infact i kind of wished it was longer so that there would be more character development and progress of relationship which i felt i needed more after the credits rolled on the final episode.

The music was nice which was a given since its a YG production.i love the R&B track sang by the male lead titled You. 

The acting was good and no noticeable cringeness. I find Kang Seung Yoon and Jang Ki Yong shine as their character of Joon Woo and Jason.

The flow of the story is fresh and rare but the execution isnt that great. The fantasy as its genre seems to be a comedy; it doesnt feel magical at all. Talking about black hole and white hole theories, Im hungry for providing more believable reasons but they only focuses on connecting the situation to the romance, even the professor explains it in a romantic way.The acting. They need to practice more before shooting some scenes, every single one of them. Their acting was below average; the camera angle only captures the visual but not the emotional needs of the story. I was annoyed at the beginning but I think I get the hang of it after watching few more episodes.Music were their last hope but unfortunately it was another letdown. At first I love how they include the OST as the song written and sung by the main character but they let him sing the song on the entire show which gets me tired of it. They added a new song, which were the duet, but it was during the last few episodes, too late I guess.I am the kind of person who believes that even a show that has a rough start, I am still hoping for a remarkable ending that will save the show from being that bad. ButIt was another failure, they need to give at least a proper closure to both second lead man and woman who was the test subject for the main couples deep feelings on each other. The romance between old buddies were not that impactful to the point that I feel the sincere love they had on each other. I am okay with them not being together. My kind of ending is when the main girl ended up with the second lead and stayed as the best friend to the other guy. The sarcasm and attitude explicit by the second lead girl was on point. The drama let her turned to be a bad bitch but thats just how a normal person react when someone keep saying stuffs about an existing white hole who doesnt have enough evidence to support her claim. Not to mention the second lead girl ask about the real relationship of the two best friends before showing her interest to the guy.I say a lot of negative things but to be honest this is not extremely bad. It was just a fine drama that really needs more enthusiasm and appeal to be consider a great one. I keep wanting to see more improvements, feel excited for the next episode, and be hooked up with the flow but they totally failed to give me all of these. As I said, the show has the potential and just okay for a mini-series."

Adaptation is based on the webtoon Spring of Crush by Noh Myung Hee. Plot: Hye Seong lives disguised as a woman because he seeks to flee the country, until one day a Geum Seong discovers his secret and falls in love with him. It started out very Korean historical comedy, much more so than the historical KBLs weve had so far (Tinted with You, Nobleman Ryus Wedding). It is, unfortunately, also largely over acted, there is a lot of scenery chewing going on. The cross dressing is definitely played for laughs and there is a Cindefella elemen. Bad wig warning. Theres a lot of voice over thoughts, people explaining what is going on to the viewer (we KNOW), and also talking to themselves as exposition. None of this is good. Its a big cast and high production values for such a crappy script: quite the soap opera, everything but identical twins was trotted out: amnesia, secret identity, lost noble heritage. This story reminds me a little of those girl disguised as a boy host club shows we got from Japan for a while  same kind of comedy that is a little beyond my ken. At ep 7 it finally got good as the boys developed a genuine friendship. The snake thing was odd though. To be fair theres a lot of odd in the show. Knives and money are gender neutral. is my ne fav quote. It had a largely suitably tragic ending (including an Untamed call back) for all the bad characters and some of the good ones. Of course I liked the psychopath second lead best - apparently my second lead syndrome extends to COMPLETELY INSANE. In the end, this drama was all over the place with uneven acting, narrative, and focus (sometimes it wanted to be a slapstick comedy, sometimes a depressing drama) which meant no one, actors or viewers, took anyone or anything seriously.... AND its a bromance. I was left wondering is SalHyung is now code for they were roommates in Kdrama historicals but otherwise largely apathetic and unimpressed. Korea, we now know you can do better. Watch Tinted With You or Nobleman Ryus Wedding instead: 3/10 not recommended, I dont know what Im watching, and neither does it."

This drama isn't exactly innovative... we have leading lady cleverly disguised as a eunich, a love triangle including friends turned rivals, political greed, betrayal in the kingdom, and a young prince who must learn what it takes to become a great king... it's literally all been done before, but the cast brings this particular story to life in a way that stops the story from feeling too clich. It did lose much of it's early appeal in the later episodes, switching it's focus from romance, to palace politics, which made me less eager to watch the next episode. Even so, I can't find much that is wrong with this drama. I think it's just a matter of genre preference, and how much you've fallen in love with the cast.

I think the entire cast was excellent. Park Bo Gum is perfect. He is completely charming as the young Crown Prince. I totally fell for his smirk, and truly empathized with his struggle to become a true leader within a corrupt system. He is matched with Kim Yoo Jung, who I was very impressed with. Usually underage romantic lead actresses seem so obviously out of place to me, but she was a formidable leading lady, and the age gap wasn't so big. Beyond pulling off the gender-bender trope pretty well, she was also very believable expressing the range of emotions Ra On had to go through. They had an extremely cute chemistry, and seemed to be generally falling for each other. They are definitely the MVPs of this drama.

Aside from the main couple, there are two young actors who also deserve praise, Kwak Dong Yeon and Jung Jin Young. Byung Yeon was so [emailprotected], and although a man of few words, his was the only character that made me actually cry.  Jung Jin Young as Yoon Sung is the perfect second lead. I didn't exactly have second lead syndrome, but I came close a few times. The friendship dynamic between all four is complicated, which makes it even more interesting. Nothing is what it appears to be at face value, and that's the kind of storytelling I think this drama did well. 

There are too many great minor characters to mention them all. I honestly can't think of a single weak link.  The villains are extra villainous, and some of the more comedic characters are completely silly, but they all felt real, and not just included to fill up space and time. 

This story is more complicated than it initially appears to be, so it's not as if I was ever really bored, but I still wish that the second half of the drama didn't lose all of the fun the initial episodes had. At the same time, it makes total sense to the story that it was told exactly the way it was, so maybe I was just in the mood to watch something lighter. I'm really trying hard to find something solid to complain about, but the music... the direction... the amount of episodes... it all worked well. Some aspects may have been a bit repetitive, which was frustrating at times, but that frustration served to motivate the Crown Prince, so I think it was necessary. It isn't exactly filled with epic twists either, which makes it not extremely exciting at times, but also not unnecessarily complicated. 

Would I watch this again? Sure. I also wonder if being in the right mood to watch this kind of story would make me like it more. I also liked that it all ended with no loose ends, which made watching the whole thing more satisfying. Even the title is explained, which was a nice touch.

Overall, this is a great addition to the pantheon of guy-falls-for-girl-pretending-to-be-a-guy dramas. Lovers of historical romantic dramas should definitely watch. Romance fans should make sure they are ready to watch something that isn't lighthearted. I also think it's a great vehicle for some impressive young talent. I look forward to seeing what's next for them."

This is a complete package of pure manufactured junk, offering no redeeming qualities whatsoever. A waste of carbon emissions as well. At a certain point, it became impossible to pick itself up from the hole it dug. The storyline was utterly unappealing, lacking any semblance of creativity or intrigue. The script itself was shoddily constructed, replete with contradictions and nonsensical elements. Every single plotline ended up being underdeveloped. The characterization was equally inadequate, with every single character exhibiting pitiful and distasteful traits. The relationships portrayed in the drama were nothing more than childish and insipid, particularly the abhorrent love triangle/square/pentagon at the center of it all.I desperately need to to seek medical attention from a neurologist to check if I developed some kind of brain worms afterwards.

This is my first time reviewing a series on MDL and I start now because I just really felt the need to tell people how great I found this series. I have marked it spoiler as a precaution because I might end up spoiling unknowingly.This kdrama's ensemble of characters looks like this - an independent and confident female lead, an open and understanding male lead, a very fine second male lead who is the best bro a man could have, and a very caring and supportive second female lead who is just a tad bit self-doubting.The story has everything from hilarious little bits, to toe-curling scenes, moments of hate and moments of understanding alike. A little thing to dislike is the pacing in the very last 2 episodes BUT I entered watching this knowing the pacing might suffer due to the short length of the series and it'd be wise of everyone else to do so too. Because otherwise the show's storyline, plot points everything was on point.My very favourite part about the series is that the female lead has not been shown as a troubled damsel of any sorts, neither has she been forcibly empowered. She is a hard-worker and good at her job. And she lives her life as she wants without much concern for judgement of others.The male lead is wary of women for he has only ever met the manipulative ones, but after meeting the female lead, he starts understanding her and liking her for exactly who she is. And THE VERY MOST IMPORTANT THING is that he RESPECTS her. Which is perfect because for the female lead hearing 'I respect you' is more important than hearing 'I love you.'And I feel this year in 2023 I think we should strive for this sort of kdrama, one which emphasizes on the mutual respect required in a relationship. Because we have seen enough love, hate, hate-to-love, but all of that is useless when there is no respect in the foundation of the relationship."

Love with Flaws,,,3570,2019.0,2019.0,32,,,,"This romantic comedy follows a woman who has an aversion to flower boys and a man who has an obsession with appearance. The female lead, Joo Seo Yeon, is a hot-tempered physical education high school teacher who always wears sneakers, jeans and training uniforms.  The death of her parents helped instill a deep sense of compassion, a generous heart and an outspoken objection for anyone who drinks and drives. Living in a house with three irascible and very attractive brothers, she loathes flower boys. Her ideal type is someone who is “not handsome.” In contrast, the male lead, Lee Kang Woo, is a handsome chaebol who focuses primarily on outer appearance. Initially, he craved attention, oozed arrogance and loved his looks--despite the strict diet and exercise regimen required to maintain it. While he appears flawless, he (like everyone else) was wounded while growing up. And those flaws--along with everyone else's--drive the story.

Craptastically bad. It starts off making fun of having to poop when stressed, which gives you an idea of the quality of storytelling we are dealing with. I know this drama isn't meant to be taken so seriously, but I think it just tries way too hard to be funny and fails. A lot of that has to do with the terrible story, but I also blame the cast.Oh Yeon Seo as Joo Seo Yeon is ok. Yes, just ok. There are some likable things about her character, but most of the time she looks shocked, mad, or embarrassed with her eyes bulging through most scenes. My favorite moments of hers were with Kim Seul Gi as her bff Kim Mi Kyung. Kim Seul Gi is definitely a scene-stealer, and her commentary and instigating is probably the best part of the whole show. I kinda wish she was the romantic lead with Heo Jung Min, but instead Yeon Seo is matched with Ahn Jae Hyun as Lee Kang Woo who is this drama's biggest flaw. I admit that I have disliked him in every single drama I've seen him in, and this is the best of the worst. At least in this drama, he almost has a personality...  a goofy one, an awkward one, but it's better than his usual lackluster roles. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but I am just not a fan of his at all. It doesn't help that he always plays arrogant characters who are supposed to be so ""good looking"" but to me, he looks average at best. I honestly don't get his appeal. Then add to that the forced romance between Seo Yeon and Kang Woo, which is underwhelming. I just don't think they had any believable chemistry. This is definitely a case where I liked the 2nd lead much more. I loved his sweets obsession. I also liked the cousin rivalry at times, but as a love triangle, it was played more for laughs than anything else. It's hard to like a romcom if you don't like the main couple, but it's impossible if the story is crap too.I initially liked the idea of a girl who likes ""less attractive"" guys but it didn't take long for that plot point to not be relevant anymore.  This drama is full of random plot points... Kang Woo's IBS, a weird homeless girl, a fraudulent therapist... that feel like filler with no substance or meaning. They did try to tackle a gay plot, which was decent, but again lacking any chemistry to make me really care. Something about it just seemed lacking. They also added a little bit of family melodrama but it honestly just felt out of place.Would I watch this again? I'm surprised I didn't drop it this time, so no.  This drama is so silly and over the top, and  I think the short episodes were the only reason I could keep watching.  I also kept waiting for a payoff that never came. They actually try to wrap everything up in the last 30-minute episode with everything resolving way too easily, but at that point, I didn't really care I just wanted it to finally be over.Overall, this drama is one you can skip. It's mostly a comedy but I don't remember laughing even once. It's a romance but peripheral characters' relationships were way more interesting than the main couple. They had good intentions with the gay acceptance subplot but it wasn't done well. I should have known from the moment that doves flew from the toilet seat that this drama was a mess. Fans of this type of humor may feel differently, or fans of Ahn Jae Hyun, but to me, this was a forgettable drama that I watched just to pass the time.  If you love awkward moments, silly misunderstandings, and poop jokes, then this drama delivers! Sadly, that's about all it delivers. I think Drama with Flaws would've been a much more accurate title."

It started out as an interesting supernatural based romcom, but the story soon became unnecessarily complicated. Instead of being suspenseful and scary, the story was confusing and boring. It's also a drama about the making of a drama, and a struggling writer... I have a feeling this writer was struggling too based on all the arbitrary twists and side plots.Usually, if the story really sucks I can at least count on the cast, but not in this case. Park Shi Hoo and Song Ji Hyo not only lacked chemistry, but their characters were more annoying than sympathetic, which made them hard to root for. Shi Hoo plays the narcissistic Phillip who spent way too much time whining, or trying to ""act cute"". There were a few moments where I thought I might start to like his character, but it never lasted for long. I liked Song Ji Hyo as Eul Soon even less. She was so frustratingly stubborn that I eventually lost complete interest in her character. I blame bad writing and a bad performance for that. Since the story literally revolves around these two characters, if you don't like them there's literally no reason to watch!The only character that I cared about at all was Lee Gi Kwang as Sung Joong. He and his character deserved better.The rest of the characters are stereotypical and forgettable, so there's a lot of overacting from the supporting cast. Sometimes they tried too hard for laughs, and sometimes they played up villainous and scary moments so much that the attempts at horror and suspense felt more like campy comedy. Then there are random twists in the story that should have made the characters seem more complex, but it just made the story more of a hot mess.How much of a hot mess? Expect to try to follow multiple ghost stories, murder mysteries that defy logic, a washed-up boy band, an obsessed stalker, and a cursed fate romance that is light on the actual romance and heavy on the series of unfortunate events. All of the major questions do manage to get answered in the end, but that doesn't mean the story made any coherent sense. It's my fault for not dropping it. Sometimes you just gotta let go, of destructive relationships and bad dramas alike.Overall, I feel pretty comfortable telling people to skip this one. If you want a romcom with ghosts watch ""Master's Sun"", or ""Oh My Ghostess"". If you want a romance about a writer that involves ghosts watch ""Chicago Typewriter"". Want a drama about a jinxed or ill-fated couple? Watch ""Lucky Romance"" or ""Another Miss Oh"". I normally don't recommend other dramas in a review this much, but that's how strongly I feel about avoiding this one! I'm starting to think a ghost must have possessed me and made me finish. That's the only logical reason for not dropping this like everyone else."

Too damn simple yet it portrays the life of an Asian family & everyday life at a police station beautifully.  All of the characters belong to different society classes and struggle through different issues.  But mostly, the story focuses on portrayal of parents' love for their kids which is the main theme for this drama. The children are what makes the parents strong no matter how good or bad the parents/children are as people. One thing all the living have in common is the love for their children. And how this love sometimes make them controlling and blind to what their children want or what kind people they become. It is that love which makes the future of the children or destroys it altogether. You'll find many version of this love in the drama.The thing that bothered me the most is: What's so wrong with marrying/falling in love with a person who has a kid from previous relationship? Its something a lot of people suffer from in Asia or maybe the whole world and the only solution lies in forgiveness and understanding. I rated it 7/10 because although at first it was somewhat interesting, by the second half I was mostly annoyed at all 3 main characters. I felt no such chemistry between the leads which was a bummer. I hated how stupid the characters were most of the time but all's well if it ends well ;)Acting: The reason I went for this 120 episode drama -> Do Ji Han x Im Soo Hyang. It's my second drama with both of these actors and let me say that Im Soo Hyang is so damn talented. She portrayed the role of a single mom really well. Had I not seen her acting in Graceful Family, I wouldn't have noticed how much she's improved. Do Ji Han, having nailed it in Hwarang, is really good here as well but he still needs more experience. He portrayed the cold-hearted police officer role really well (his character was annoying as well tbh) but he needs more experience if we compare him with his co-start in this drama!Next, I liked actor who played Jin Dohyeon. His portrayal of spoiled 30+ year old rich person was spot on and I loved his character development the most before it became victim to the writing. He's a jerk, mind you but he changes in around episodes 70 - 95. Other actors were fine, good if not the best. Huijin did her role of annoying older sister so well that I actually hated her. I'm finding myself annoyed by the actress too. LOL. Music: It was fine. Nothing that stood out for me ;)Re-watch Value: Nah, nope!

Now she has been accepted to the most prestigious art college in the land.One day, she meets Ha Ram, an astrologer whose fate is the polar opposite of her own: Although he was born sighted, he lost his vision in a childhood accident. Regardless, he is also in possession of an astounding talent that allows him to read the future by tracing the movement of the sky at night, despite the fact that he is blind.The duo is sucked into the machinations of the royal court, particularly those involving two princes, the free-spirited Prince Yang Myung, and the cruel, scheming, Prince Joo Hyang – a man who longs to become the next Joseon king.(Source: Viki)~~ Adapted from the novel ""Hong Chun Ki"" (홍천기) by Jung Eun Gwol (정은궐).","Ahn Hyo Seop, Choi Kwang Il, Gong Myung, Kim Kwang Gyu, Kim Yoo Jung, Kwak Shi Yang",SBS Viki ViuTV,"Charming but Ridiculously Ridiculous  Watching the series made me feel like they were trying to fool me. It is a fantasy drama but i feel like even the creators werent taking it seriously.Let me talk about the good things:1. The art. The focus on artworks made me appreciate traditional Korean (and asian) paintings. I love how they showed the details and the skills it take to create these masterpieces. The painstaking strokes and technique in painting the kings portraits are absolutely stunning to watch;2. Good, if not above average special effects;3. The cast. Kim Yoo Jung and Ahn Hyo Seop are not particulary great but are still charming. The real revelation for me is Kwak Shi Yang, he is just captivating to watch as an antagonist. What about the bad:1. ""Convenient"" plothloles. They created story obstacles but they also created very convenient solutions - kind of like a loophole to get out of these problems. Uncontrollable demon? Lets give them a ring for it. Lost sight at the most crucial part?Lets give them a magical being to give them extra power. The family is to be publicly executed?  Lets magically bring back an ailing king to put a stop to it. These situations, among others, dont feel like twists, but lazy and random resolutions to conflict.2. Main character is blind but actually moves like he isn't, he can even ride horses for crying out loud. He puts on a mask and walks around like he's normal. Plus, he IS a stargazer, an astrological reader who can accurately predict the future by watching the stars, because why not, they think we'd believe it, even if he is blind.3. The rudest most entitled  #metoo normal girl in a korean historical drama. Like  when she was to lose in the painting contest and she cries foul and asks why, like a spoiled kid in tantrum4. They pretended that you can hear brushstrokes when somebody paints and you can tell what is being painted. Come on!5. I feel like they wasted the chance to use the royal shaman into something better or even sinister. She was neither good nor exactly bad but I was kind of expecting her to do something grand in the final ritual, She was there to salvage her reputation and save the kingdom  only to suddenly die without really doing anything.First part of the show, specially the first episode got me hooked, however halfway through the series, i was just there just to finish it like watching a drama so you can submit a report for it.  Halfway you'd realized you know where its going and everything, and i mean everything became predictable. Will i rewatch? No. Will i recommend? Not really, there's a whole lot of other better dramas out there."
Lovestruck in the City,,,2413,2020.0,2020.0,17,,,,"""Lovestruck in the City"" is a realistic portrayal of young people who pursue romance and happiness while struggling to get by in a busy, competitive urban environment.

This thief of his heart, and his camera, has disappeared, much like a fleeting midsummer night’s dream.Lee Eun Oh is an ordinary woman who temporarily re-invents herself as the spontaneous and free-spirited Yun Seon Ah. On a whim, she heads to parts unknown, where Jae Won falls in love with her new identity.(Source: Netflix)","Han Ji Eun, Ji Chang Wook, Kim Ji Won, Kim Min Seok, Ryu Kyung Soo, So Ju Yeon",Daum Kakao TV Netflix,"It's been a while since a drama annoyed me this much. I'm not even sure why I watched every episode of ""Lovestruck in the City"", but I definitely could have skipped this one. This drama tries to be different by being more self-aware and mimicking a reality TV format. The main characters confess to the camera throughout the show, which got old for me fast, and then we see slices of their lives in reality, how they all connect, and how reality contradicts what they tell the audience. If I'm honest there is only one reason I kept watching... Ji Chang Wook. Sadly, the last drama I saw him in was equally awful ""Melting Me Softly"", but he is always so charming that I'm willing to watch a terrible drama just to watch him smile and be in love. If this drama had a less appealing actor in his role I would have dropped this after episode one.So how was the rest of the cast? They were good, but it was hard to separate characters who were badly written from the actor. Kim Ji Won is a perfect example. There was nothing wrong with her performance but her character irritated me for the majority of the drama. She had pretty good chemistry with Chang Wook, but I honestly didn't understand what made him so obsessed with her. The chemistry wasn't enough to carry the weak storyline. The other main characters did a good enough job of being distinctive but bad writing made their stories pretty dull. I won't spoil how the stories connect but I guess the point was to explore different kinds of relationships (the good and bad) between men and women... friendships, crushes, long-time commitments, encounters with exes, casual relationships, and summer flings are represented. For the entire drama the only character who didn't annoy me at all was Kang Gun, but I was honestly bored by all the other interactions. The women characters is particular are often irrational and make frustrating decisions. I think I was waiting to relate to the characters as I got to know them but that never happened. I was just constantly waiting for the ""story"" to start. Sadly once it started it turned into one repetitive episode after another. If I could describe the plot in one word I'd say it felt pointless. If you like the idea of non-sequitur relationship snippets then maybe you will like this more than I did. To me, it felt like filler interrupting the main plot which didn't have enough substance to fill all 16+ episodes. Then there's a weird resolution at the end that feels thrown together, that's  interrupted by another random story with random minor characters. I think I would have liked it better, maybe, if there was a different story each week because this just felt like I was watching an unscripted mess. That didn't make it feel more authentic to me either, in fact, it felt more fake, especially with the awkward product placement moments. Would I watch this again? Hard Pass! Not even for Ji Chang Wook's smile. Also, the random old school rock ""theme"" song with the unnecessary music video was equally irritating. Overall, this drama felt like a concept without a plan. I guess I can piece together moments that I liked enough that it kept me watching, but there were far more frustrating moments that made me wonder why I didn't drop it after every single episode. More than anything I didn't care at all about who stayed together and who didn't, which is bad for a romance-themed drama. There are intimate confessions that seem out of place, especially since the characters seem to have no idea who is listening and responding. Do you enjoy watching people act irrationally in relationships, and drag out misunderstandings, or drive people they care about crazy with their unresolved issues... then enjoy. I can't imagine sitting through this for another season myself, although I can see there being a possible setup for one. Since there were many times I was literally rooting for the main couple to never deal with each other again, I can't recommend this drama. Yes, eventually there are reasons and amends but the frustration to get there made it very anticlimactic. I definitely wasn't lovestruck with this drama. It almost makes ""forever alone"" seem like the better option."

The girl believes in luck and she goes through rituals or consults her shaman before her every action. That's okay enough. But, half way through, she just changes her beliefs just like that. I know love is strong etc etc but still, I would have preferred a better representation of the girl's personality and inner thought, as her beliefs weren't unreasonable for her. Maybe the cause of the whole romance driven story was the fact that they might wanted to make a light romance drama rather than a little more dramatic. But still, if so, they shouldn't have created such a dramatic background for her. Anyway, other than that, the drama was okay, with a strong and funny start, but with a so so ending. The love story was cute and the couple had some chemistry, but the girl got a little annoying down the way. Still, it was okay, with some great performances. So, 4 out of 10."

Why? Because even though in its core, it was a typical crime drama with raging power politics and a band of underdogs trying to uncover the truth, it put a unique spin on the genre.The concept of the drama was based on Insurance crime and for those who don't know much about it, it might as well be a little complicated to follow. The scenes where all the schemes and cases were explained were dialogue heavy with some technical terms and for watchers who want their shows easy to digest, it could be a bit of a problem.That's not the case with me though. I don't like my dramas to hand me everything on a platter. I want to be able to think about the events taking place and then have this lightbulb moment of 'Oh, so this was what happened.' I like it when a show makes me replay some scenes to catch a dialogue I missed because this means that I care and a drama has to be good if it makes me care.I'm not gonna say Mad Dog was perfect. It had some flaws here and there, some plot-holes, some illogical things but when you looked at it as a bigger picture you saw that actually yes, this could've happened in real life too. It wasn't far-fetched from reality and you realized that the plot was indeed very well-connected and backed up by smart characters with brilliant planning who were always trying to one-up each other.While the show started off slow, focusing more on introducing all the characters and their dilemmas, once it hit the 9th episode mark- it skyrocketed and the real action came out in play.However, the strength of the show wasn't its plot, rather it was the character development. This was a story about how a team (Mad Dog) of lovable individuals each with their own unique talents joined hands with a lone wolf, scam artist (Kim Min Joon) and how together they grew into one tight knit group that was closer than family.Every role was beautifully constructed and the moment I felt that a character wasn't getting much attention, the script changed its course and swallowed down all my complaints. Besides our amazing team, there were some very endearing side characters (Nurse Sem and Manager Park) along with intriguing and well-portrayed antagonists that helped the show retain its charisma.Yoo Ji Tae is an actor that emotes with his eyes and Mr. Choi with his vengeful looks and determined actions gave me so much life, especially because YJT's acting was exceptionally brilliant towards the end. Jo Jae Yun (my all time favorite supporting actor) once again brought forth a memorable character. Cheetah shi was so cute with his matchmaking skills, a softie heart and the gangster ways. Kim Hye Sung with his adorable Pentium; a genius and kind-hearted boy, stole many hearts and Ryu Hwa Young gave life to the badass, headstrong but caring Jang Ha Ri that you couldn't help but adore.But, despite the presence of the more experienced and brilliant cast members, Woo Do Hwan once again snatched all the spotlights. He should honestly be named 'show-stealer' because whenever he takes a role he owns it so completely that other people are given a deadly run for their money.Try as I might, I couldn't believe this was just the second show he's starred in because he's just too fucking good. He's the kind of artist, I can imagine in every possible role because of his humongous talent and versatile personality. Without bias, I can say that despite being a newbie he's one of the best actors in dramaworld. I love the way he walks, his charming quirks, his beautiful smile and his amazing voice. (Now, is where the bias is speaking.)So there was no surprise in the fact that Woo Do Hwan's Kim Min Joo slayed me completely and then went for more. Kim Min Joo with his German adlibs, sneaky personality and fearless swag was truly one of a kind. He was incredibily smart with a talent in annoying people to death. He loved pulling everyone's leg, all the while calmly laughing while doing so. He was a bit arrogant, definitely not one to mess with but ultimately, a huge sweetheart. I loved how realistic his character was. He didn't develop magical super powers when people came to kill him (and they came a lot) nope, he innocently got beaten every time instead, was a huge scaredy cat and couldn't even throw a punch properly. And I loved that. The highlight of the show was seeing him warm up to other people and letting go of his trust issues and finally being given a family that he could rely upon.The dynamics within the Mad Dog team (Kim Min Joon included) were simply everything. The way they had each other's back was extremely heart touching. These people had so much love for each other that at one point, I was shipping every-one with everyone. I loved their little missions, their secretive and conspiring shared glances, their smart strategies and their protectiveness of one another, so much.And last but not the least: The romance. Even though it was done as a sub-plot only, it was so so good. Kim Min Joon and Jang Ha Ri were a match made in heaven. The small moments they had with each other were so incredibily sweet and their chemistry was fire. The minor touch of romance in this show was far well-done than some of the wholesome love stories I have seen. I think I've never wished for a kiss scene before in my entire life. But ah, we can't have it all now can we?While Mad Dog did have some great 'Oh shit, what's going to happen next' scenes, it wasn't a show centered on 'the bext big thing'. The beauty of the show was in the small, intimate moments between the characters, the way they grew on each other and the way they evolved together and as individuals.If you let it, Mad Dog will make you feel. It will touch your heart deeply and make you feel joy, sadness and love. So much love.I really enjoyed the OST of the show. From NiiHwa's popping and catchy track to Eric Nam's soulful ballad- the sound track did great things for the mood of the drama.I loved the cast and their antics, so much so, that I really didn't have the heart to let them go till the very end. Although the ending was a little bit rushed, it left me with a wide smile and some heartfelt happy tears.So while Mad Dog might not be everybody's cup of tea, it was a steaming mug of delicious cappuccino for me.Definitely one of the better shows of 2017 and one I surely recommend.Enjoy!"

Not only does it have a very fluffy dog but also allot of fluffy moments and a sweet, sweet ost. the drama has great side characters who show typical K-drama development making you annoyed in the beginning but  leading you to fall in love with them by the end.  The drama also shows a person who likes to cross dress as a competent and complex  human being who is more than just a stereotype, yet manage to show the reality this person faces in a day to day life. The drama also touches issues such as poverty, mental illness but mostly violence against woman in various forms.  All things making this drama worth a watch. Add a great OST and one might wonder why I did not give this drama 10 stars. There is one reason, and one reason only for the lack of stars, though the female lead does show some character development, the way she is written is a bit off and rather adds to mental illness stereotypes than  breaking them. Also conveying people who have dealt with trauma as completely broken, and yes that bothers me.  I am not saying that there is a right or wrong way to deal with trauma. And can not say that I fully understand her state of mind. Some people may be able to identify with her and if that is the case all the power to you. what bothers me is that this is this feels to stereotypical and that I have seen this before  adding on this notion of broken , crazy and paranoid  woman also used as well as showing us it as an excuse to treat others badly.  The state they show her in is one where she is so paranoid she needs allot of protection and though she is getting help her state is so extreme that it is letterly dangerous for both her and people around her to let her walk the streets = A person who should get more help and stay in an institution until she stabilises = not the typical victim.  And yes I am team there should be no shame in going to a mental institution when needed. to add to this her character development is to extreme for the lack of help offered to her.   And yes that bothers me. She does however have allot of great lines. the male lead is a complex antihero but a sweetheart for most parts (but he does contradict himself) and the show overall is mostly entertaining with mostly good humor, but unfortunately also some humor that just makes me go oh come on, and how the h*** is this funny.  So overall definitely worth a watch, just dont judge it by the first episode. p.s. Lee Su Hyuns character and singing rocks in this! gave me a new crush, not bad for a supporting role."

I loved Lee Joo Hyung's character portrayal - I just wanted to climb into my laptop and mother him!  I also loved SJ's understated acting in this.  He portrayed a quite complex person, who starts out as a seemingly selfish, immature, snob of a psychologist (but not cold - even though he is emotionally stunted) really well, as the character could have been completely unlikeable, but he managed to keep me on his side, though not all the time.In general they are all pretty selfish characters at times, but that's where their similarities end, as it's a great mixed bag of people.I liked the various psychological issues that were visited through Prof Choi Soo Hyun's clients, with some very emotional stories amongst them.The huge importance of support and understanding needed by those suffering mental health issues underpins the whole series, I felt.  As is the equally important need to address and seek help for anyone suffering severe changes in behaviour.Childhood trauma is at the forefront of many of the individual stories and some are quite upsetting. The devastating affects mistreatment (whether it be psychological or physical) can have in later life is made blindingly obvious.Soo-hyun's character development made this drama for me, to be honest and Sung Joon played him perfectly.  The last episode was so very moving.What let the drama down for me was the times when humour was mistakenly added in the form of silly, childish dialogue and behaviour. It is possible to prevent a story from sliding into melodrama, by adding even dark humour, which doesn't resort to immature behaviour that just didn't fit with the rest of the storyline.  Felt like it was plopped in to prevent the story from becoming too heavy.  More creative writing could have provided laughs on a more adult level, befitting of what the drama is about at its core.One of my favourite friendships was between Choi Seung-chan and Dr Bae Mi-ran.  It was writing like that, when compared with what I've just said, which made me wonder whether the author of this drama doesn't have two personalities, like one of the characters!Worth watching, although I probably wouldn't revisit it."

It's literally never important again, even though they spent the entire beginning of the show detailing it.The bad guys realize exactly how the phone works after only seeing it happen once, and not even seeing the phone itself during that one time. The final confrontation is very overplayed. The acting is overdone the whole show, actually. And the idols in the company are so obviously unhappy and uncomfortable around their managers/CEO/etc that it seems incredibly unbelievable that no one has noticed there's a problem. There are side characters that apparently had side plot things happening but we never actually see it, so randomly at the end we're told about how this dream or that dream came true for them, but we never knew they had that dream in the first place, or that any of this side plot related stuff even existed?I did like that the ending stuck to the original statements made about the magic cell phone, but that's about it.

He's always been the best actor of the group and to hear he got a mini drama was pretty awesome and the premise of a Magic School seemed pretty interesting.Story: It's hard to say this actually had a coherent plot. It's four different people; a student, a doctor, a professional magician, and a scholar, plus their teacher coming together at the Magic School. That's really it. There's no supernatural magic, just card tricks and stuff you'd see on TV just so you know. The story follows all four characters and their motivation for studying magic, how one person assists another and a touch of romance but the plot really doesn't 'go' anywhere if you will. There's no main antagonist so the 'drama' of this series is a bit flat. I found myself drifting away in the middle of a scene and having to re-watch parts since the story didn't engage me.Acting: I was pretty neutral about the cast aside from Jinyoung but no one disappointed me. It's hard to act when the plot is weak at best. I was surprised by Yoon Park as Jay, his character had the most development by the end of the series. His motivations are laid out clearly, and in the beginning he is not the most likable character, but at the end you empathize with him and realize he's not absolutely terrible. I wish the female characters were a little stronger, both Park Kyu Young (Woori) and Shin Eun soo (Yi Seul) are great characters. Yet, their motivations and personalities we not given as much depth as their male counter parts. Music: You will eventually hear a Day6 song towards the end of the series. The ending theme is memorable but not too loud or annoying, aside from those I really did not pay attention. Nor was anything else really memorable.Rewatch: My rewatch value is always low. Unfortunately, despite being a short series I don't think I would ever re-watch this. However, if you're looking for something light to spend around four hours with, this might be something to consider."

It's the outer limits quadruple triangle, orphan, lowclass mom, women fighting over money, affairs, life threatening illness, amnesia, etc, etc. It made you miss the simple kids bullying and killing other kids stuff it started out with... and as a mother myself, that's not something I take lightly.

The 1st 18 episodes were great.  A tough ass mom whose son died who does everything to teach the kids at the school lessons their own parents are failing to teach them, and support them to be happy and successful.  But all of a sudden the focus started become more about the Family Feud that was portrayed like a Joseon Historical with princesses lying &amp;amp; scheming, vying for the title of Crown Prince. Every episode was just merely a flipflop of the previous one, with SIL #1 on top then SIL #2 on top... and the men acting like ghosts, except for dad who is an island unto himself. They manage about less than 10 minutes cut into 1:30 segments in each episode with the OTP walking SLLLLOOOOWWWWWLLLLLYYYY away from each other or staring at each other or opining on whether they're allowed to love each other and be happy... 

Let's just say that more than 2/3rds of this show, the school children are no where to be found, the very thing that made this story great, and the whole time I'm saying to myself, ""I don't give a shit about anyone's family.  I just want to see her continue to help the boys at the school grow and mature, and teach the parents lessons in humanity... while knocking heads together.""  After the lead fell in love she was a wuss and shell of her former self... spent her time getting spoken to and treated like dirt without laying a hand on anyone, crying all the time, and walk around like she's in a comatose state.  ....it's like they spent so much time on the SILs being nasty they were completely out of any ideas for their lead. 

You know, it's being pulled in for 18 episodes then wrecking my mind for 22 more that pisses me off.  I feel extremely cheated by these writers who seem hell bent on being sadistic with their unwillingness to give you what you want."

Yes, the first episode that aired had a scene or 2 that wasn't very ""nice"" and respectful towards the culture that was being used as a setting, but you know the PD and studio were sorry when they put an apology infront of every episode that aired and they even removed said scene(s) from any streaming or ondemand services. This series is being drilled into the ground because of a mistake they made in 1! episode and in my review I'm going to look further and not let this one-time occurance get in the way of the true gem this drama is.

--The Characters--
Let me just say, the characters are amazing, they all have at least a decent backstory. No character is empty or just there to fill air. They all have some role, even abdallah who is just a right-hand and probably has the least backstory honestly for me was one of the most enjoyable characters. This actor is someone you should keep an eye out for, he's amazing.

--The Story--
If you take everything away, the story is nothing special. It's a normal plot but it's being made awesome by the cast. They truly went for it and it makes you feel good.
The humor is amazing too, choi min-soo as the rich long lost father is gold. He manages to put this silly humor into his scenes which turns all of them into magic. 

--Overall--
Overall this drama is gold, the characters all add something which turns a simple plotline into so much more. 
Please don't let all the hate talk on the internet turn you away from this drama, it's definetly a must watch and you won't regret it."

The main focus/conflict is Kevin Miller and people connected to him. Go Jung Do is there for first 20-ish episodes then he turned to a guest character with the purpose of giving reactions. His story was cut short, he disappeared in the last 10 episode then got a quick update at the end but we didn't know how he made up with his wife. Why make him and his wife main characters in the first place if you gonna neglect them. Speaking of neglect, I wish the divorce plot was given more attention, it would create a better dynamic. The synopsis/plot and the drama started with them but they weren't given more than 5 episodes about their divorce issue. Also, Jung Do's mother who created a massive mess and was considered the main villain suddenly disappears around episode 30. Finally, the female lead doesn't feel like one, barely given any attention to her character writing and most of the other characters stand out more than her. The drama had a big issue with pacing, plot layout and incoherent writing for the reasons I listed above. One thing really bugged me is how every single secret was blown out of proportions like it was a world ending event.  The drama itself is fine, casual family drama with some melo, I was just expecting more of it.  Most of Seo Hyo Rim roles are the usual evil female antagonist but in this drama she's the exact opposite and it's great. Hopefully we can see more of that in future drama."

promising. However, the drama was tiring, with a boring plot that

Plus, the story hadn't developed yet and frankly everything seemed confusing and tiring. The drama picked up after episode five or so. The story tangled up and got messy, but at least there was some progress and the main character had some development, as well as his understanding for his friends and his relationship with them. The side stories took the lead at some point, which wasn't that bad as they were interesting and entertaining. However, in the end they weren't concluded well enough as the main romance did.

Money isn’t the only thing required for happiness, and love makes life worth living.","Kim Yong Gun, Lee Hwi Hyang, Lee Seo Jin, Park Jung Soo, Shin Rin Ah, Uee",MBC,"Marriage Contract is a drama that I can see why people gave it high reviews, but I just can't do the same. Don't let the classic romcom marriage contract between a rich chaebol and a broke girl plot fool you, this is a bonafide tearjerker. Did this drama make me cry and cry again? Absolutely, because the main cast is amazing. What's my problem with Marriage Contract then? Well, read the title and the synopsis and you basically know everything about this drama. Yup, That's it for all 16 episodes. The story is so basic that this drama is definitely saved by the acting!

Uee and Lee Seo Jin took super clich characters and made them feel real. I'm not a Uee fan, but I was super impressed. Her character goes through so much, and she nailed every moment. I think she's missing some of the charm that other actresses have, so she often comes across as too cold for me (even when she's being sweet), but she gave a very believable performance. Lee Seo Jin gave a great performance too, that proved he's more than just dimples. My only complaint is that some of his really big smiles looked more creepy than genuine. His tears however were extra heartbreaking. Watching their bittersweet relationship is the heart of this drama, and why it worked at all for me. 

I admit that in the beginning I didn't like any of the characters. For the first few episodes no one was likable, not even the cute kid. Uee was the most sympathetic in the beginning, but she was also so pathetic that I was frustrated watching her. Then, around episode 4, things finally started to shift for me. Suddenly I was binge watching, barely able to stop myself from watching what happened next. Han Ji Hoon became more charming, Kang Hye Soo became more admirable, and their chemistry started to develop into something engaging. Shin Rin Ah as Eun Sung was also such a strong character that I think she deserves a main character status. She gave a performance that showed she was just as talented as her adult cast members. If she's that good now, I can only imagine how good she can be in the future,

The rest of the supporting cast was excellent as well, even really minor characters, except for one. Kim Young Pil was really bad, like REALLY bad. I almost removed a whole acting point for how bad he was. I'm not sure it was all his fault, because the character was written as being petty and ridiculous, but he just seemed too over the top and fake evil, even for a melodrama. Honestly, all of the characters are pretty one note, and don't have much depth, but the actors managed to insert depth into their performances. Like bad dad Kim Yong Gun, who was text book evil, but he was such a believably unbelievable character who's outrageous actions cured a lot of my boredom with the rest of the plot. 

I think the writer is the problem for me. The plot is predictable, it's full of everything you've already seen in a drama. So many of the female characters seemed to be irrationally obsessed with men (husbands, exes, sons) that I often had a hard time empathizing with them. Some of the episodes felt repetitive. There were about five episodes where the literal plot was cry, plan to divorce, cry again.  Some other episodes rely heavily on flashbacks, which was annoying. I became invested in the characters and their relationships, so I could never bring myself to stop watching, but I definitely had to push my way through to the end. It did pick up momentum again in the last episodes, and I did like the ending (though it was nothing original), but I just didn't fall in love with this drama the way others did. 

This is similar to the problems I had with ""Secret"", which has the same writer. Weak characters, a predictable plot, skippable scenes, a pathetic lead character always in tears, dragging episodes... 

I did like the direction, the same guy who directed ""Kill Me, Heal Me"". That, and the cast may be what made me like this drama much more than ""Secret"". My one complaint is that the blatant product placements were pretty hilarious.

I thought the music was not great either. Some of the music chosen seemed so out of place. I did appreciate that Ji Hoon's ringtone was mo' better blues, which  gave some insight in how important music was to the character. Too bad they never incorporated a real musical storyline in the actual script.
That could have helped me understand why he struggled so much to join the company. 

Would I watch this again? Only if I am feeling apathetic and want to cry my eyes out to prove I still have feelings. 

Overall, I would only recommend this drama to fans of super sad melodramas like ""49 Days"" (which had too much cloud of impending doom for me), ""Scent of a Woman"" (which I loved, and had similar themes), or ""Secret"" (which proved to me I do have a melodrama limit). Romance fans will be able to appreciate the love story, and some of the family themes are heart warming, but this is a drama you have to buy a jumbo tissue box for and then just embrace the chronic eye wetness."

It does what I hate in dramas so well that it made me love it! I was honestly hooked, in spite of myself, from the very first episode. This is the kind of drama that requires complete suspension of disbelief to enjoy it, and I had no problem doing that for all 20 episodes.

So, what do I hate that ""Mask"" did so well? We all know in KDramaland that ridiculous coincidences will most likely happen. People often meet in the exact right spot, or miss each other by seconds, or just happen to overhear something they needed to know, or have the exact right thing for the exact right moment... This drama's plot is 99% coincidences. Even how the doppelgnger scenario is introduced is way too coincidental. This usually drives me crazy, because it makes everything so unrealistic, but in Mask's case it didn't matter to me. The more random the coincidence, the more frustrated I got, and the more addicted to the plot I became. Maybe because it adds an element of literally anything might/could happen. The 20 episodes flew by because I was so addicted to finding out what was going to happen next. 

The second thing that drives me insane are dumb leads. I spent much of this drama wanting to reach through the screen and slap characters, or shake some sense into them. This usually turns me off to a drama, but in this case I had to keep watching. I will admit that I liked the villains more than the leads. Don't get me wrong, I liked Min Woo and the wife known as Eun Ha's chemistry, and love story, but I still preferred the bad guys, even if I didn't want them to win. 

I think the cast did a great job. Soo Ae was good at looking tortured by guilt, or being overcome with grief, while also shining a killer smile once in a while. Be warned that the smiles are not often. She looks depressed for the majority of the show, but with what happens, how can you blame her? Then there's the equally straight-faced Joo Ji Hoon, the obligatory socially awkward rich guy with a short fuse, and issues from childhood. Of course he is still totally crushable and sympathetic as the show progresses. I had totally forgotten what dramas I had seen the two of them in before (he in ""Goong"" ,and her in ""9 end 2 Outs"") because they are so much more mature now. Their matter of fact romantic banter was cute, but I did wish there were more romantic moments that weren't so stiff (there are maybe 3 I can think of total). And why did they insist on going to sleep in full outfits? Dude was wearing a sweater??!!! *sigh*... Instead they do a lot of staring, which felt like such a tease. It is still a very touching love story, but there are more emotionally touching moments than butterfly moments. 

Now about those villains... I did love to hate the loan shark, but the true power couple from hell is Mi Yeon and Seok Hoon. Yoo In Young plays the most man thirsty woman in the history of KDrama. I just finished watching her be the jealous beyotch in ""Oh My Venus"", but this jealous beyotch character suited her much better. She was also the one character, in all of this drama's madness, that actually made me cry at all. Then there's Yeon Jung Hoon, the true MVP of evil. I kept rooting for his evil plans, because even though he is basically a sociopath, I respected his intelligence and commitment to revenge. He was my favorite of the cast, so I guess it's about time I check out ""Vampire Prosecutor""

Now, would I watch this again? Doubtful. Most of the excitement of this drama was guessing what would happen next. I do recommend it though, especially if you are looking for something extremely melodramatic! There were times when I laughed inappropriately when I should have been sad, or concerned, or times when I cursed loudly at the screen, but there was not one single moment when I was bored. It's a 20 episode drama that I marathoned through faster than some shorter dramas. I'm not sure I would have been able to handle the stress of watching it live and waiting for episodes. 

This is a lose sleep kind of drama. Even the last episode threw in some new twists, while still making sure everything was resolved in the end. I'm glad my early misgivings about KDrama tropes didn't make me stop watching. ""Mask"" really was more addictively entertaining than I ever would have expected."

It's not perfect, but it is definitely a hit. I was debating on what rating to give this, and I believe an 8 is about right. For example, some parts I felt were added by the writer for a plot twist, but they didn't need to be added. Acting was surprisingly amazing, as I am not familiar with anyone in this beforehand. It makes me curious about their other work. OST was great too, it didn't show up too often, but it was nice when it did. I noticed sometimes the sound-effects were a little out of place but it did not hamper my enjoyment. Re-watch value is higher than normal just based on episode structure.

I started the drama with zero knowledge and expectations. I knew the acting would be top notch with a cast like that, but truth to be told, the story did not sound like something I might enjoy. Well... I was wrong.I fell for each and every character presented. This is how everyone should write interesting, fresh, original and flawed ones. I hated so many of the choices they made and actions they took, but I could understand why they did them. All the bad behaviors were never excused, but always explained. And I found it extremely refreshing.The story slowly presents to you that whatever happens is almost never just one person's fault. At the end of the day, it is your choice to stay in a bad situation and turn a blind eye to what happens in your surroundings.The drama has a lot of really meaningful and deep messages, including: consent in a relationship, understanding your worth, impact the past struggles have on your current self, fear of happiness and losing it. You learn as you watch it. More than once I read a line a character has said and just simply nodded my head in agreement.Any flaws? The ending was too good. I was quite honestly hoping for some twist by the end. I was sad with how Maru and Soo Kyung's story was dealt with. There clearly were hints left, but they never followed with any conclusion. It's worth mentioning the painfully unnecessary Dong Goo's story line. From the beginning till the end, I was not even slightly interested in his character and the romantic subplot he's got.Overall, I believe it's an extremely underrated drama and I wish more people would give it a shot. The first two episodes might leave you speechless and it's hard to understand the characters and their motivation, but as we get to know them better, they start to feel like old friends. The familiar feeling just calls you in."

At first, one would think it is just another comedy, 'feel good', very fictional, TV series.  It was easy to drop it just because. But, a fair warning, doing so would be to your detriment. This series is about life, the value of relationships, and yes, what death means for you and me.The story transcends faith and religion. This was beautifully depicted with the Catholic priest and the Catholic confessional box; as well as, by the Buddhism beliefs of the other characters. Life, relationships, and death, are universal, and commonly have the same depth of meaning regardless of one's faith and religion.It isn't about ghosts. In fact, there is nothing paranormal in the story, rather, it is more supernatural. A higher being supernaturally allowed the female lead character to have a spiritual Stella's touch. One last opportunity to for the dead to make their wishes known; and for the living to have peace.The ending is a must-watch, but only if one watched the series from the beginning without skipping anything. It is rare to see an ending that blows the audience, and leaves a long-lasting impression. An ending deserving of the beautifully woven story of the male and female lead characters, and their relationships with their loved ones, their regrets, and their hopes.This TV drama is a story about you and me. It is a story about the living and our dearly departed. It is a story of healing and moving on. A story of regrets and hopes. It is painful, sad, and you will definitely cry no matter how strong you may be. But in the end, it reminds us how good it is to live, and that all the pain and hardship of life we may have gone through and will go through, are nothing compared to having been loved.May I Help You?---Originally posted on my blog: Snoworld | YourOnly.One (https://im.youronly.one/snoworld/may-i-help-you--2022-review-2022357/)"

I appreciate its witty and grounded touch. I also appreciate the playful, sassy and natural at ease dynamic between the two leads. You get wit without silliness and on top of that an exciting story. In addition, the question (which is obviously burning at the moment in South Korea) about the solid handling of the rule of law in the face of apparently overpowering forces that control politics, the executive and the judiciary, is intelligently incorporated into the network of relationships and case processing.The story is based on a book with real cases, written by public defender Jeong Hye-jin (""Let Me Start the Argument""). This makes the Disney production a solid enrichment for current courtroom dramas. In addition, this KDrama doesnt try to downplay its KDrama roots in favour of international streaming market standards. The KDrama remains true to itself and doesn't rely on more violence or sex than usual It rather builds on proven emotional storytelling with an excellent cast and a loving eye for the nuances.The intro offers an impressive, brilliantly cool stylization of the KDrama orbit, in which the one percent of society is always involved: the fircely quarreling, shaken by internal intrigues and secrets, outrageously rich family clan, in which everything is about the best law firm, the greatest impact on the prosecutor's office or the fat contract. Here you have to be clean, untouched, respectable (which you rarely are). The profession of choice is a lawyer and/or sooner or later assemblyman and ideally a presidential candidate.So far, so good... weve seen it many times. Now, however, the story is driven by a new powerful perspective: the world of public defenders who handle legal cases from the world of ordinary, often destitute people at the bottom of society. Worlds clash - worlds both with people involved. The interface is incorporated by No Chak-hee, who has lived in either. As the number 1 in the law firm, in which she has just been promoted to the youngest partner, she is being transferred to the mandatory public defense. What she doesn't know: this is mere political calculation of her very esteemed superior. What she also doesn't know: the encounter with her new colleague and the world of public defense will unhinge her worldview and give her work new direction and grounding.Suspense has the central characters fatefully under control. A series of murders occur. Crimes emerge behind old, long solved and forgotten cases. No Chak-hee realizes that even she can no longer wash her hands in innocence. Guilt. Innocence. Right. Wrong. Culprit. Victim. Justice. Injustice. The perspectives get a bit out of the sounding line.KDrama at its finest. Good entertainment, while also being socially critical and up to date. Pithy. Nonchalant. Intelligent. Exciting. Romantic vibes included."

But when people pay attention, you'd think that they can hear your thoughts. This is a cute short drama.

Last two episodes are just fluffy addition as the main couple tries to find steady speed in their relationship.The actors were ok, not the best, not the worst, just average. The ML had such smooth voice and the FL was not particularly pretty. They still managed to make her look worse with the frumpy wardrobe fit for a grandmother!  The writing was alright:I liked the narration. there were a few cringy moments and the ML's explanation was so sweet. Why do these web dramas have such awful music?

So if you like that type of theme you will probably enjoy this too. There where a few small issues here and there that bothered me including their portrayal of people becoming so obsessed that they go insane in a pretty stereotypical way. The last episode was also a bit of a mess most of the time... making the pace, sloooooooooow, slooooow, fast, slooow. slow... mess... The teens here did a amazing job, and so did the leads portraying characters with all kinds of development and personality changes... And It was done brilliantly!

Plus, the soundtrack was nice. Also, I liked the side characters that were cute. But, the main couple had zero chemistry, and the love story didn't help at all. There were too many clich holes that the plot fell in, not to mention that they never explained the killer's motives, the guy's super powers or the girl's second personality.

I felt the same way about ""W""... that this could have easily joined my list of favorite dramas, and there were so many elements to the story that I loved, but there were also too many things that could have been better. I can't say that I disliked ""Memories of the Alhambra"" but I can say that it didn't quite live up to the hype. What I loved about the story is the main plot revolving around the augmented-reality videogame. It's hard to go to into it without giving away too much, but I loved the world they created, the unexpected twists in the story, and the mystery element that intrigued me to the very end.  I also loved Hyun Bin! He was great as reluctant hero Yoo Jin Woo and always plays the charming jerk role so well. He is one of my favorites, and it was great to see him as a leading man again. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the leading lady.Park Shin Hye as Jung Hee Joo is probably the thing I hated most about this drama. I can blame the writer for making her character so pathetic, but I really think a better actress could have made the role work. Even though I have liked her in other roles, in the drama she seemed out of her league. She had zero chemistry with Hyun Bin in my opinion, and he really seemed to be trying much harder to make their romantic storyline work while she basically cried and looked slightly surprised most of the time. He had much better chemistry with his assistant than with her, he even had better chemistry with the little sister, and since romance becomes a major element in the story it definitely added to my disappointment. The rest of the cast, in general, was good but there were times when the side character stories seemed more like filler, made the story drag, and didn't hold my interest. Some of it made sense and added to the story, like the scandalous love triangle between the two bffs, and the father played by the always brilliant Kim Eui Sung, but most of the side stories just didn't live up to the excitement of the game world. I didn't care at all about Jin Woo's second wife or Hee Joo's friend zoned guy pal. I would have much rather learned more about the development of the game. I liked the show much more in the earlier episodes when there was more focus on just the game world.I was also impressed by how this drama looked visually. The Spain locations were great, and the virtual world elements looked impressive and believable. I liked the incorporation of the Spanish guitar too which made a beautiful melody so creepy, especially if it happens to be raining while you're watching.The rest of the soundtrack was just ok in my opinion.Would I watch this again? Probably. The game world alone was entertaining enough to watch again, although I would be tempted to skip through all of Park Shin Hye's scenes where she isn't the mysterious Emma. Since the story jumps around in time so much it may be interesting to watch again knowing what's actually going on.I also have to give a shoutout to the genius product placement! There were the usual blatant moments, of course, but the way some brands were incorporated into the story was pretty brilliant. I also understand why people were disappointed with the ending but I was more indifferent. Parts of the end actually made me tear up, and other parts made me roll my eyes. It seemed more like a set up for a sequel than a real ending anyway, but I think they did their best to give most of the characters some kind of closure, even if I didn't care about some of them. Overall, this is a drama where there may be plot holes, lapses in logic, an overuse of narration, and a love story that lacks chemistry, but it makes up for it in originality and intrigue. I was excited every week to watch the latest episode all the way up until the end, which honestly felt like it came too soon. So I would still recommend this drama, even with its flaws. It's another ambitious story that may not have lived up to its full potential, but it definitely stands out among other dramas. I really hope to see Hyun Bin as a leading man again soon, with a better leading lady. I also look forward to the next sci-fi drama by this writer,  because it may not have been as good as it should have been but it was certainly extremely memorable... *cue Spanish guitar and thunder* o.O"

This show is a long journey and even though at times exhausting, its so worth it. What I really loved about Mental Coach Jegal was the complexity of the characters. The flaws were not just random setbacks - they all had a solid explanation and served as an amazing character development arc. I liked how the show kept reminding us that what we see is neither the beginning nor the end of their journey - they had their own struggles in the past, they have their own motivations for the future, and what we see is just the present self that keeps changing. Its like that for Je Gal Kil,Cha Ga Eul, Park Seung Ha, Lee Moo Gyul. There is more to these characters than we initially think. I honestly enjoyed the majority of them from the start, and even Goo Tae Man was impossible to hate. That said, the character I found difficult to accept at first was Park Seung Ha. I honestly found her more unlikable than the bad guys themselves. It was too hard to ignore the lack of professionalism in her previous conduct in her professional life. The drama is magical though, and I started to appreciate her more and more as the story progressed, and her past actions, while not excused, were explained in a way that I could move on and see her for who she was - a flawed human being, like the rest of the characters. I think that's the overall positive aspect of the drama - it's rich in different contexts and (both internal and external) factors that influence the characters, and the solution is not easy to find, since no one solution can solve all the problems.Then we had the villains and antagonists - some better, some worse. I feel like the main villain was underwhelming in terms of the lack of depth. With all the characters being so complex, he just did not fit that picture. As if the last stroke of the brush in a masterpiece was done by a 5 year old child. Then we have Oh Dal Sung - trash, the truest cockroach of kdramas. At some point I was not even frustrated or angry about his character, I was just tired. I wonder if there was any other way to deal with his story without hurting the overall quality of the plot and other characters arcsThat said, for a show that is focused so much on the internal fights and struggles within the characters mentality and approach, the writers did quite a good job with presenting the villains that overall did match the plot and pacing. Although some were more of a plot device, not individual characters, I still found a certain value in the way they were written.About writing - I don't think I've ever watched a drama where I really wanted to write the quotes down. Im more of an appreciating in the moment and moving forward type of person, but here - the narrations and dialogues were so well written I just had to pause the scene many times and type down the words to share with others. They just hit all the right spots and were relatable on an indescribable level. ??? ???? ?????? ???? ?? ??? ???? ?? ???'? ???? ??? ??? ?? ????? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ???? ??? ???'?. ???? ?????? ?????? ??? ?? ????, ??????? ??'? ?? ???? ?????? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ????? ??????.Big picture wise, Mental Coach Jegal addresses many important issues, both specific to the sport related environment, but also the things everyone can experience in their lives. I am amazed how they managed to make it all logical and have a significant impact on the plot and the characters. Without going into any details, the various traumas and issues the characters had to face, different ways they all dealt with them, whenever victims have any responsibility in what happened to them and how they should or should not handle the aftermath, the lack of support, inadequate support, shame, psychological issues - there are so many themes and topics its impossible to write them all down. And I honestly feel like the majority of them were dealt with proper respect and maturity from the writers. To the acting. Jung Woo is a master of chemistry. He truly made a perfect team with each and every character. There was not one interaction he had that felt boring or flat. He could talk to a tree and I would find it the most entertaining thing ever. Him and Kwon Yool are a duo I will miss for weeks. The way he found a perfect balance between the comedy and seriousness, how Jegal was both eccentric and relatable. I am truly amazed. I expected a phenomenal performance from Lee Yoo Mi and it is what Ive got. I started the show because of her and I was not disappointed. She perfectly embodied the idea of someone being both vulnerable and strong. All the rest of the cast did an incredible job. I cannot think of one performance or scene that was lacking in any aspect. The production had a similar effect on me as the writing - I could not stop myself from screenshotting. I especially liked the use of the wide shots - they often looked like beautiful paintings. All that said, the drama was not perfect, even if at times it felt like it is. Few things that could have been improved and can be seen as flaws.First of all, Je Gal was introduced as a famous mental coach and writer. He was not a nobody, he was like a celebrity. But his fame was downplayed and non-existent after just a few episodes. I feel like him having rather high social status would be an issue for the plot to unfold the way it did, so that fact was just ignored and removed from the equation. Rather poorly done transition between the leading genres/plots. At first the show was more or less a sports slice of life with comedy. At some point it changed into a political drama with comedy, and that transition was not done smoothly. You can literally tell which episode is the turning point and its a clear cut deal. I did not mind where the plot went, it made sense. I was bothered with how it was executed. Not utilizing enough No gold medal club. I feel like they either should have been even more in the background, or more prominent. They were neither the supporting characters, nor just a filler background - somewhere in the middle that I could not get attached enough to truly care about, but also not insignificant to just accept whatever happens to them. Since I loved each and every character in that group, I did wish we had seen more of them, especially in the middle part of the show. Some questionable relationship developments I could do without. While they made sense character wise, I also felt like they were not truly needed plot wise. I could understand why they happened, but I also asked myself - did it have to happen? To sum it up - it was not a perfect show, but for me it was close to perfection. By the end, I was so attached to the characters I honestly feared the day the show would end. I was not ready to say goodbyes. I think a great show is not a perfect show, since these dont exist, but one that makes you ignore/forget the flaws. They seem so insignificant compared to all the positive aspects, you just dont mind them. Mental Coach Jegal did it for me. And Im known for complaining about the most minor details ever. Mental Coach Jegal had some convenient solutions by the end, but I cant bring myself to lower the rating, even if some aspects were not perfect in my book."

I like Shin Ye Eun, but she wasn't a good fit for this drama, or maybe just her character was too ridiculous? I don't know. As for L he is still a weak actor, but ultimately the main problem here is not acting, but rather the script. The story is on the boring side of terrible. I mean honestly what qualifications does one need to become a kdrama writer? I'm typically not the type to look at a painting & say ""this is nothing I could do better"", but in Meow the Secret Boy's case I think I could come up with a better kdrama plot in like 20 minutes. I mean sure plot is not all that important in a cute fantasy romance drama, but even the basic romance is just not done very well here, also ""cat life span melo"" is like the worst idea ever in a show like this.. As for the ending, it's basically a noneding. The last 2 episodes were especially boring & there is no satisfying conclusion, I don't think. We see a deus ex machina thing with the webtoon & then he is human again! Great, what's next? Is this the cliffhanger for Sabrina the Teenage Witch season 4? The whole point of the kdrama format is to give viewers a proper closure.Honestly who is the target audience for this? The whole thing feels incredibly juvenile..I'm okay with silly romance shows, last year I loved watching ""The Secret Life of my Secretary"", but that show has much better romance, it's much funnier & also it has more charm."

The performances were good from every actor and actress in the cast, too. Also, somehow, even though this web drama is only six episodes long, the love triangle was solid and entertaining.And now, for the minuses of the drama. The idea of the plot was nice, but it was underdeveloped.

The second  couple was on and off screen and it was probably only there to fill in the scenes between the ones of the main couple's. So, overall, four out of ten."

Without even reading the synopsis, I dived in and Midnight Thriller ended up to be a surprisingly pleasant and enjoyable watching experience. Midnight Thriller consists of 3 episodes and its an anthology of 3 stories. Each story has its strong and weak points and some aspects are done better in one story than another. Overall, all the stories left a good impression on me.  Surprisingly, the production in total is quite meticulous and technically sound, giving the drama quality and at the same time, artistic tones. The only thing lacking is the music which is like the music you hear in an Escape Room with a horror theme or a Haunted House. Despite that, the music still fitted with the dramas tone perfectly.  ~~~First story : Friendly Police~~~Friendly Police is a psychological, mystery thriller story. It was the creepiest and the weirdest of the three. The plot is quite predictable, or it isnt? If you watch it, youll decide yourselves and thats what makes Friendly Police a very unique story. The biggest disadvantage is that the story is very slow paced and it can be tedious. Still, the pace might not affect you so much. The ActingThe acting was superb, the best of the three stories. The main leads are portraited by Kim Yoon Hye and Jung Jin Won and their chemistry was insane. I have watched KYH in other dramas (Vincenzo, Sh**ting Stars) and yet, her performance in Friendly Police is her best. It was my first time watching JJW and I was amazed, this actor really has some skills.   ~~~ Second story : Follower~~~Follower is a crime, mystery thriller and my favorite story of the drama. As a crime thriller, it gave me strong Agatha Christie vibes. The plot is very well written and executed so as a result, the story has good coherence, pacing so you wont feel bored at all. The story isnt predictable but if you are observant, you might suspect what is going on. All in all, this story was very enjoyable to watch and Id gladly watch it again.The ActingThe main lead of the story is Cha Ye Run alongside Jo Han Sun and Kim Jung Hwa. CYR was the reason I discovered Midnight Thriller as I was searching her filmography. In Follower, she was quite captivating and she delivered her emotions successfully. I think she is a brilliant actress and Ill keep searching her filmography and hope I will see her in another good drama soon. JHS and KJH did a pretty good job too.   ~~~ Third Story : Supermodel~~~Supermodel is the most suspenseful story of the three and also, the one with the most aesthetic cinematography and directing.  The plot is quite interesting and manages to keep you attention till the end as a result of its good pace and structure. The story is far from predictable as you cant see the ending coming. Honestly, I was quite shocked with the ending.  The ActingI have to say that I wasnt as impressed as with the acting of the two previous stories, mainly because of the acting of the supporting characters. The main lead of the story, Lee Shi Ah is, in my opinion, a good actress. Her interpretation in Supermodel was decent and thats why the third story had in the end a good outcome.  ~~~Conclusion~~~Im very happy I discovered Midnight Thriller. Each of its stories had something to offer me and impressed me in its own way. Even though they werent perfect, I was completely satisfied with what I watched and Im craving for more thrillers now. Its really a shame that Midnight Thriller is undiscovered by many. If you are a thriller lover and want to watch light mini-drama, then Midnight Thrillers should be on your radar."

It is a crime drama with action, comedy, heartwarming moments and you can't help but applaud every character for their performance.The story introduces a male prosecutor, Do Be Man, who reluctantly joined the military to only make money by throwing cases. During the first episode or so, you might destest the male leads actions but don't give up on the show.Soon he is teamed up with a new female prosecutor, Cha Woo In who appears naive and helpless but Do Be Man doesn't quite buy it.  He turns out to be right because she part-times as a red headed vigilante to fight bad guys that the law can't reach.Eventually she manages to get him to team up to take down the entire unjust and corrupt authority figures in the military. The entire process is exciting because the female lead has been given equal relevance in the show which is rare to see. She can hold her own both in fights as well as the court of law. And the male lead is flexible in both guiding her with his experience in the courtroom as her senior as well as following her lead in the fight against justice behind the scenes. A very healthy relationship is seen between the pair.Besides the strong female lead, we also get to see a strong female in a negative role that manages to scare even the men. Not only is she strong physically but also cut throat and an intelligent adversary.  It was a wonderful portrayal!A third strong female was Do Be Man's aunt who played a police captain and also provided many light moments in the show.One thing that truly impressed me is that the show doesn't shy away from presenting the negative aspects of the military that can plague any institution like corruption and bullying and how the military court is required to be impartial in order to serve justice. A final bonus is that not only does Do Be Man's sound like doberman, a breed of a dog, but an actual doberman also features on the show adding more joy to the wonderful show.There are many other wonderful characters on the show that add to the brilliance of it through their depictions of positive, negative and grey characters. The show might seem predictable but the journey has many surprises in store and will make you rethink your position on some of the characters and situations. Please give it a watch!"

However, there are things about it that are weak...The background music didn't always fit the scene. Usually, the music was too joyful when the scene was serious or sad. It was really distracting.Actually, every character has experienced its own development. But it was really fast. The character's attitude changed in the blink of an eye, which is very unreal.The thing is, ""Mimicus"" consists of 16 short episodes, which makes everything happen too fast. No storyline is developed enough. I believe the drama would be better if it had longer episodes.

This show most definitely will not fail to intrigue it's viewers. I've already watched Sky Castle, The World Of The Married, and I'm waiting on Penthouse 3 to premiere, so you already have an idea of my taste in kdramas. I was waiting for another's drama like the ones mentioned above to come and my prayers were answered. This one is just as fascinating and with fleshed out characters to match. And a murder isn't a bad way to start off a show either.One thing I want to talk about is the overall feel of the show. It has an aura of mystery but one that affects how you view the characters and their actions. It's hard to articulate but it's like you know what's going on but at the same time you don't. Even if you think you grasp the characters and their motivations, there's this invisible fog that's clouding your judgement. That might've been purposeful on the writer's part but it only draws you in so you can find out more.Each family member has secrets of their own and a storyline to go with them. The character I found most intriguing is Seo-hyun. She is the composed member of the family yet she is concealing the most damaging secret! Kang Ja Gyeong's backstory is crazy but the journey to finding out what led her to going up her son was really good. Hisoo is very likeable, which is good for dramas like this. In a world full of sinister characters you need someone to root for. My favorite storyline is that of Suhyeok and Yoo Yeon. They were quite minor but I'm a sucker for forbidden love and I just really found their dynamic interesting.I definitely recommend this if you're a fan of the previously mentioned shows or if you just want to satisfy your craving for backstabbing rich families and dangerous secrets. 9/10"

Missing 9 is one addictive drama at least episodes 1-15 are. Episode 16, not so much.  They could have made episode 15 about 25 minutes longer to tie up the story and end it.  The final episode had too much obvious filler and not enough tension.  And the last scene came from outer space. It's like a new director took over for a quick second.  But I digress.  The story is quite good.  It's nothing like I thought it would be.  Early comparisons to Lost were far off base. There's a plane crash and that's where the similarities end.  Missing 9's characters all mostly know each other for better or for worse. They all belong to/work for the same Entertainment Agency. The writer(s) did a good job in character development and setting up a well layered mystery even where there didn't seem to be one. The characters had camaraderie and there were a number of humorous scenes. The cast as a whole did a marvelous job and they had great chemistry. They seemed to work well together.  The incidental music did a great job of supporting the story and helping move it along.  The songs were ok.  I really didn't pay much attention to the main song that played throughout the drama probably because I found it uninteresting.  I really did enjoy Missing 9, but I don't see a reason to re-watch it. To be honest though, it's rare that I ever want to re-watch any drama.. Overall, it's a solid well done drama and very much worth watching even with the weird, obvious add-on scene at the end."

First of all, this is definitely one of the better crime investigation dramas out there and evidence that OCN can indeed produce great shows. I lost faith after Neighborhood Hero, but Missing Noir M was able to mend my shattered heart.

The acting was thoroughly awesome. Not only the leads who had great chemistry in a non-romantic way but also every single guest actor/actress who played important roles in each case. They were able to make me excited to a point where I couldn't stop watching while at the same time I was worried that I'd finish this drama too fast. It's unfortunately only 10 episodes but I could have watched 10 more of it. The cast delivered their emotions and messages so well, that I'm still stunned when I think about it. Though I didn't really cry, they still moved me to tears so many times. This was about interpersonal relationships which were put to proof under extreme circumstances. It's about justice and injustice, and about trust and suspicion.

What I loved so much here was how every case was built. Disclosing one secret always meant to find ~10 other secrets within that had to be solved in order to see the whole magnitude. Layer by layer and in the end the picture always looked completely different from what you had expected in the beginning.

Though I must say that I didn't enjoy the last case as much as the earlier ones. Maybe it's because I prefer psychological mind games over corruption cases. I know what they wanted to tell their viewers with that last one, but I still think that it didn't really fit well between those other mind-blowing puzzles. It seemed rather short and rushed and failed to properly explain its own story. It felt plain compared to the other cases.

There were also some loose ends, especially the reason why they even formed that special missing persons investigation team when they were so worried about opening Pandora's Box. It was quite well explained for the first case but for all the other ones, it remains a mystery to me.

Background music was, as I already mentioned some days ago, exceptional. So damn well composed, balanced and in sync that it managed to liven up every important moment to its full potential.

Not gonna lie, this is not the most complex story I have seen. Its the same old crime for greed dressed in fantasy elements. Yet, this fantasy set up makes it stand out compared to other shows and make the watch more enjoyable. I honestly don't care much about the investigation, if it was not directly linked to finding the bodies of the people living in Duon Village. Sure, the mystery was well crafted and had great pacing, but I honestly don't care about the living people involved with it. The plot shines the most when it focuses on the residents and how/why they died. Some of the characters I liked the most were Thomas, Jang Pan Seok and Baek Il Doo. Most of the cast had a great chemistry between each other, and the friendship between Wook, Pan Seok and Thomas was fun to watch. Sadly not all characters had much to offer. Personally I found Choi Yeo Na painfully annoying, and at times quite selfish. She had little going on as an individual character, and mostly served the role of delivering exposition and motivating other characters to do some work. There was nothing interesting nor entertaining about her. No complaints about the production. Maybe some of the cgi was questionable, especially when the residents were leaving the village - the more detailed, longer and more close up the scene were, the worse it looked. That said, Missing: the other side was a beautifully crafted show with quite a number of screenshot worthy moments. Overall, a fun and easy to binge watch show. I took my time with the first half, but watched the second in one sitting. While there will be a second season, this one can be easily watched as a stand alone, as it provides all the necessary closure."

Not to say this season was bad. There were quite a few elements I enjoyed a lot. It was simply not as good as season 1. Why? Because there was little to no development nor arc for the 4 out of the 6 main characters - they already went through it in the previous season. First of all, in terms of the plot, the mystery seems impersonal since for the longest time we dont really know why its even connected to the leads. Its just something they come across by an accident. In season one Pan Seok was the connection between the male lead and the ghost. Here it just happens because the plot needs it and there are no personal stakes and the few connections we have are not enough. Characters wise, I liked the two new leads. Eun Sil was a great addition, but I feel like there was not enough focus on her - how she manages the village, how she interacts with others. Il Young is probably my favorite character. Obviously he had some issues and a dark past, but also seemed like a good person. That contrast made me curious about him. They did well in establishing the mystery parts like how he was able to leave the village, how he knew Thomas, what was his connection to the crimes happening in the outside world. I feel like we only got glimpses of the village here and there and it was never truly the center of the show. The aspects I actually liked the best in season 1 were the storylines about the ghosts, not the investigation happening in real life. I wanted to see more of the ghosts perspective - depth of regret only someone who has no chance to fix their mistakes can have. Not to mention the whole idea of kids, their understanding of death and where they currently are, how the learn to be happy for the ones that leave the village - aspects that were not really explored enough. Il Young is probably my favorite character. Obviously he had some issues and a dark past, but also seemed like a good person. That contrast made me curious about him. They did well in establishing the mystery parts like how he was able to leave the village, how he knew Thomas, what was his connection to the crimes happening in the outside world. As for the rest of the main characters - nothing changed, nothing improved, nothing got worse nor better. They were all rather stagnant. Kim Wook got glorious hair and they tried to give Jang Pan Seok some interesting arc of not being able to let go of the past and traces of his daughter but I felt like they dropped the topic at some point without conclusion. The whole real life investigation was just mediocre at best. Random generic bad guys with no depth, little to no established motivation and awful fashion sense. The only good thing about the investigation was the fact weve got to see Shin Joon Ho a little bit more. Production value was great - great sceneries, great set design, good special effects, nice visuals as all tvN shows have. Acting was great - with this cast I expected nothing less. They did an amazing job with the casting, especially taking into consideration how many kids were part of it. Sometimes finding even one child that can deliver a believable character is hard, here they were able to find quite a few. Overall, its exactly what one would expect from a second season - enjoyable, even if it did not get anywhere near the quality season 1 had."

Jung Won was the worse. she cheated on her husband and the acted as if he was to blame, and just becasue her husband cheated first didn't justify her though she didn't even know that. and most of the time she acted as if she was better than her friends and that everyone was out to get her/make her do things for themselves. and though she did do those things, it kinda made her seem self centered..anyway, now on to the crime/mystery! it was a huge mess xD at 1st I thought their crime happened in the past but knowing that it was the future was a good move..on the other hand, the other mysteries mostly had nothing to do with each other but they made them seem as if they were connected..so, the teacher Eun Soo cheated with was killed by Chang Hyun's mom becasue she thought he was the lover of her daughter in law who Chang Hyun was ""accused"" of killing, and Eun Soo killed up after her to hid her own cheating, then the teacher's son came into the picture and Eun Soo wanted to redeem herself.but it turns out Dong Seok was the lover but he had nothing to do with either murders? and then Chang Hyun was killed by who? I don't know.. but then Sang Hoon tried to blame Young Dae to bring him out of hiding, and well that was the only ""reason"" to have so many murders connected with each other..Young Dae was a crazy mess, but! that ending! I was wondering this since ep6. if they showed Young Dae's body missing and then found somewhere else, then why the heck did the 4 fls still tried to hide his body? I knew from then it meant whatever they did didn't kill him and that there was another murderer, so why?he was coming out of the water and he had more blood on him. they could've ended it there. and they all seemed to forget Jung Shim was around..anyway, I also feel cheated that Sang Hoon was alive. all throughout the drama (especially after they showed he was innocent) I hoped he was alive. but for them to make us think he was dead until the last scene was a cheap move. I wondered how his daughter and Jung Shim were running around if one's dad died and the other's mom was a killer, so I mean I'm glad he didn't die but still..the female centeredness and the fact that it was a ""mystery"" and short was the only thing working for it..the ost was nice, it had elaine~ and I never rewatch stuff..."

A group of friends who are from all different nationalities and walks of life live together in a global share house. When they hire a female house keeper, she comes with more than they bargained for when her spoiled friend joins the mix. A very cliche story, with a script that goes no where and lack of character development. There is a random dance break in the middle?

Money Flower,,,1430,2017.0,2017.0,24,,,,"Managing director Kang Pil Joo is envied by many inside the Chungah Group where he is known for his intelligence and high-performance. He keeps his real identity a secret from the Chungah Group founding family and serves them as an obedient servant but he is actually grooming them for his scheme. His plan was to make Mo Hyun fall in love with Jang Bu Cheon for his revenge, but he finds himself falling desperately in love with her free-spirited personality. The “Money Flower” portrays a story of interlinked relationships between Pil Joo who is capable of bringing down Chungah, Mo Hyun who seeks love and a young Chungah Group scion named Bu Cheon. And these characters all come to the fore as money dictates their lives in a web of desire, greed, and love.(Source: MBC)","Han So Hee, Jang Hyuk, Jang Seung Jo, Lee Mi Sook, Lee Soon Jae, Park Se Young",MBC,"Money Flower is one of the most intense dramas I have ever watched. It felt like watching someone trying defuse a bomb while I was in the room. This is a slow burning revenge makjang, but I was hooked from start to finish. Don't let the seemingly slow pace fool you, because this drama is filled with suspenseful cliffhangers that will leave you sleepless from needing to know what will happen next. The cast is what really sells this drama, with so many brilliant performances. At the center of it all is Jang Hyuk, in a role that I think is him at his best.Jang Hyuk first won me over in Fated to Love but this role is completely different. There's no infectious laughter, in fact he rarely cracks a smile, but as Pil Joo he shows so much emotion behind what on the surface seems like a permanent poker face. From the beginning I was fascinated with, and rooting for, Pil Joo. Seeing the constant torment on his face at each betrayal, then watching him always be a step ahead, was an addictive combination. Even though he is insanely manipulative, he's also extremely sympathetic, and it's impressive watching this master strategist implement his ultimate plan for revenge. Whatever praise he gets for this role is well deserved.The majority of the rest of the cast is just as praise worthy, and help create the perfect atmosphere. With a character like Pil Joo, you need characters just as compelling to make the story work, and although everyone was really good, Jang Seung Jo, Lee Mi Sook, and Lee Soon Jae were perfection. I loved Lee Soon Jae's matter of fact callousness as the head of the Jang family, Jang Gook Hwan (aka Grandpa from HELL). He was so nonchalant about being so unbelievably evil that I almost had to laugh at times. I adored Seung Jo's manic charm as Boo Cheon (the ultimate frenemy). Boo Cheon was so complicated that he's the kind of character you sympathize with and want to see destroyed. I loved him, and loved to hate him. He was also really good at saying more with his expression than words could. He had one scene where just him closing the hotel door was one of the most gripping episode endings.Then there is Mi Sook's Jung Mal Ran (aka Psycho Mommy Dearest). Mal Ran is the kind of villain that I love. She somehow made being completely unmerciful attractive. Without giving away too much, she is the main target for Pil Joo's revenge, and their scenes together are many of my favorite moments in the show. It seems weird to call what they had chemistry, but that's what it felt like... intense rivalry, constant suspicion for sure, but also a little sexual tension. Even her outfits were amazing. I already liked her as one of the dueling mom's in Jealousy Incarnate, but I had no idea she was capable of this kind of performance. She is the worst mother possible, but in the best way!The only character who was good but not as great as the others in my opinion is Park Se Young. As Na Mo Hyun she did a good enough job, but with such an epic cast it's easy for her to look mediocre in comparison. It could also be the way her character was written, being the least duplicitous of the bunch. She does hold her own in many scenes, but always in a way that still seems to leave her out-shined by her costar. I guess being the only goodie two shoes among the vicious can have that effect.Betrayal, greed, and revenge is what drives this drama from start to finish, so don't get fooled by the genre tags or the synopsis. This is about THE WORST family you could ever imagine, and the fight to see who will be the next to lead the company once grandpa dies. Even though I've seen way too many dramas with this kind of plot, I don't ever remember one doing ruthless so well. Don't expect laughs, or anything even slightly resembling comic relief. Expect lots of people not trusting each other, and for good reason. Still it doesn't go overboard with melodramatic sadness, so its more engrossing than depressing. Instead of romance, I would say there is intense longing and deception. Instead of law, I would say that these characters take extreme liberties with the law in ways that are very entertaining. This is a drama where you wonder how far each character will go for their goal, and then stand back and watch them probably go way beyond what you would imagine they would do... at least that was the case with me. I had many jaw dropping moments at their actions.Another thing worth mentioning is the music. It's less about songs and more about how much music is used to drive the intensity in the story. I especially loved the cliff hanger music at the end of each episode. Once I heard that music play I knew something unbelievable was about to happen. Even in the last episode, when I thought they couldn't possibly fit in another twist, that music always told me otherwise.Would I watch this again? Absolutely, but I couldn't give it a perfect rewatch score, because knowing what will happen does lessen the intensity. The performances themselves are mesmerizing enough to keep me watching, but cliff hangers lose some of their charm when you know what will come next.Overall I highly recommend this drama. The writing, directing, and acting were all too good to miss. If you want something light to watch, this is definitely not for you, but I'd still say add it to your queue for when you may be more in the mood. If you start watching and feel like it's too slow, this is one of those dramas that just gets more and more exciting as it goes on. If the idea of a makjang scares you away, think of it more as a revenge drama, and if revenge dramas aren't your thing, maybe think of it as a character driven melodrama. I say this because Money Flower is missing some of the elements I normally love in a drama, but I didn't really miss anything at all. I started watching with no expectations, and an open mind, and I knew early on that this would end up on my favorites list. It was so fun being shocked every week, and wanting to curse at my screen. I was satisfied with the end, and liked that it still left me wanting more, but with enough closure to not feel cheated. After 24 episodes I am sad that it's over. I'm not sure there's another drama that can fill the intensity void this one will leave."

It shouldn't be a spoiler to say that there's murder and suspense in this drama. now it's not the main focus of this and they don't try to investigate, but that tension adds alot to the structure of the story..the simple version of the story is ""power struggle"", good vs bad, greed, and the basic ""they are trying to steal our money""..that tension and the characters are what made me stay, I honestly love how layered and realistic the characters are, Lee Hye Joon is the most level headed normal female lead in dramaworld. Lee Sung Min is honestly such an amazing actor! I mean maybe korea always knew/admit that, but in some ways I feel like he's underrated or maybe he just focuses more on movies. but his character here was just so beautiful.it's like the events of this drama didn't just randomly taint him, and I feel like that happens alot of characters like him, they are like driven by hate/evilness...basically, no one was the ""bad"" guy, no one was evil, but also no one was pure good/righteous. they were just people driven by their background. their past made them who they were and that just means the writers did a really great job making them. I first gave the story a 8.5 becasue the business aspects were lost on me, but the characters actions and words/dialog made me change it.and yes, Eugene Han.. rather than saying he's the reason I continued this drama, I prefer to say ""he was the cherry on top"". he's such an intriguing character, and I'll only say this as a fangirl, but he is the cutest xDalso, the pace of this drama is actually really nice, like by ep12 usually most dramas go downhill, but here it actually feels like a solid 12eps have passed and we have enough time for the rest of the story. it doesn't feel draggy or rushed.and I'd actually either love a 2nd season, one episode of romance based plot with these characters, or a romance drama written by these writers. honestly, if only they focus on their characters in a romance genre instead of following the usual patterns xDthe ost of this drama is gold!

As with ""Designated Survivor: 60 Days"", ""Suits"" or ""The Good Wife"", this South Korean remake also sticks closely to the original. Many viewers may work through what is better, whether it is necessary, etc. - Not me, though. Rather, what fascinates me is how specifically Korean socio-political dynamics have been woven into the present story and suspensefully catapulted into a global consciousness. Against this background, the series is truly brilliant. Most viewers might probably miss this or could care less, and thus don't even pay attention to it. Nevertheless, this or that might eventually fall in places, unconsciously.  Be as it may be... ""Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area"" takes place in a fictional economically united Korea. This premise as a setting alone is ingeniously visionary, because it conveys into the mass consciousness such a not sooo unrealistic agreement scenario for the stuck situation between the two countries: An economic union that could be profitable and attractive for all sides... Yet, immediately the potential stumbling blocks are swimming in the wake... Exploitation, fraud, abuse! The promise of freedom and unlimited opportunity turns out to be just more profit and opportunities for those who are already living in the fast lane. The promising scenario for peace and prosperity for everybody might be one side of the coin, a raised index finger is pointing to the other side already: Attention! Wiheom! Danger!""Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area"" is provoking with a dramaturgical ""Hello-Wake-Up!"" - On the one hand these potential capitalist dynamics could make a promising peace scenario possible, but on the other hand, in the same breath, would also torpedo it. This is where the big plan of the 'professor' comes in. He wants to counteract the machinations of the powerful, who are busy filling their already full pockets, regardless of those, who pay the price. Thus he comes up with a spectacle that will shake up the public (and their decision-makers). In the end this might ultimately force the system to be more mindful and aware in approaching a true joint venture in order to make it work for the people (not only the CEOs and the powerful).In this context, the characteristic difficulties between Koreans from North and South are successfully demonstrated again and again: the deep distrust that has been actively cultivated for so long. The fear that the war, which has officially not ended yet, will openly continue. The constant spying. The contempt for the other system. All of this was politically tirelessly staged for more than half a century. Families were being torn apart almost at random back then (1950s) - like in Germany after the Second World War. At a time X, some were on one side of the boundary line and others were on the other. Coincidence. Fate. What followed after that was propaganda, both here and there. Building up an enemy image. And what was done back then, even if the framework conditions for rapprochement might been created, has to heal over time first. (This can be learned by the experience in Germany: having reunited for more than three decades, still in society the 'wall' between Ossis and Wessis has not yet been truly overcome...)""Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area"" succeeds in weaving a realistic future scenario for a united Korea into an exciting story. With all difficulties and opportunities. In this respect I consider this KDrama a strong production. In doing so, the KDrama brings this possibility of a Korean peace closer into the mass consciousness - first of all for the South Korean society, which is extremely sensitive to this topic, but ultimately also for the rest of the world. I also have criticism.  This is neither concerning the story nor the actors, on the contrary. And it is not about the fact that connoisseurs of ""La casa de papel"" will be strongly reminded of the original (including the names of the characters). No. I rather have a more general complaint regarding many Korean Netflix productions (vs. the national KDrama TV productions). -First, there is the spice up of the narrative style for an international (rather male) eye that is generally used to a good portion of sex & crime and a higher pacing. Well, I dont need it.-Second: Why not really telling the story to the end? Yes, it could be ""worth"" one or more seasons, but nevertheless. They even split the first season into part 1 and 2. I dont like it.-Third: The sensitive emotional momentum, that is so crucial for KDramas, is reduced to the max. Yet, the strength of a KDrama, in my experience, is that we are emotionally drawn inside, that we identify ourselves, feel empathetic, and get very close to the protagonists, get involved into their world. International Style on the other hand is rather characterized by keeping a critical distance. Here the audience is watching from the outside. The story and acting may grab you, but you stay outside and watch. You don't necessarily get emotionally involved. What is happening will be and will remain the story of others. In this particular case as well. So unfortunately once again a central KDrama unique selling point was abandoned for the standards of international Netflix world. This is not necessarily bad, yet different. I would say the experience of watching is less intense compared to other KDramas.Luckily, the KDrama in general has more than one crucial strength and can instead show off some of those others. So does ""Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area""..."

Why was the only option to seal and bury the statue and not destroy such a dangerous thing?The first two episodes were really good but the 3rd episode made it all about people getting possessed and killing each other. I understand that it was important to explain why the statue was so dangerous  but it would have helped to understand why the evil spirit works in this way. This episode just reminded me of zombies. Also, there was no consistency. Some people were affected very quickly while others were delayed in getting affected. What was the importance of having a strong heart? It seemed like there was no one strong enough to resist the statue.I thought the scene with the crows was quite incredible visually. I just felt like it was pointless to the story.

First, I will start by saying this drama is not good. It's pretty terrible honestly, but it was somehow still amusing enough for me to want to keep watching. This is a romance with an unconvincing love story.  It's a good concept with a weak plot.  What kept me watching? The characters and the promise of a funny love story kept me wanting to watch each new episode, and I really hoped that the romance would eventually get better. It doesn't.  It's like they threw a bunch of my favorite ingredients into a pot but the final dish was at best... just edible.  The first issue I had is with the leads.  I love Kim Ji Suk & Jung So Min individually. Both are in kdramas that I consider my all-time favorites, and both are a part of couples that are among my favorite kdrama couples of all time.  The problem I have is that they just didn't seem to pair well with each other. Kim Ji Suk is comedic and ridiculous, which is what I loved about him in ""Oh Hae Young Again"", and Jung So Min is great when it comes to emotion, which is why I loved her in ""The Smile has Left Your Eyes"".  The problem here is that ""Monthly Magazine Home"" is a pretty silly comedy, not a serious drama, and it really seemed like they were acting in 2 different kinds of dramas at times. I think Kim Ji Suk was well cast as Yoo Ja Sung because of his over-the-top personality, but I could not take him seriously in any of the more dramatic, romantic, or emotional moments. Jung So Min is great and relatable as determined Editor Na and does have some funny moments, but she just doesnt match the complete silliness of the rest of the cast and spends too much of this drama looking upset, apologetic, and out of place. They did have some good banter in the early episodes, and I liked their initial awkward scenes together, and Ja Sung's random motivational moments, so I thought they would have better chemistry but their dynamic becomes more cringy than cute over time. Ja Sung's weird in love smile and Editor Na looking like a confused hostage in their most romantic moments was a huge disappointment. I liked their characters individually but not together. I wasn't even convinced they really liked each other.The rest of the cast was amusing, but definitely playing more for laughs than depth. The feel was a little (ok a lot-tle lol) like The Office, finding humor in the dynamics between these quirky work characters, lead by an egotistical boss who never quite gets it. These are the pettiest coworkers on earth, and how they support and then quickly turn on each other is the main joke. That gets pretty repetitive, and sometimes annoying,  but I did grow to like them enough that I still found it mostly funny.  What didn't work as well for me were the more serious moments between these characters, which included some pretty bad acting moments, especially Chae Jung An. I adore ""Coffee Prince"" but her acting here is really not on everyone else's level. Meanwhile,  Kim Won Hae is always funny in any drama he's in, including this one, and Ahn Chang Hwan was a comedy standout as well. Sometimes his antics went overboard, but he was consistently good in his role.I also feel the need to shout out Jung Gun Joo as Shin Gyeom, the obligatory 2nd lead. He's everything you could want in a 2nd lead... cute, understanding, rich, dimples... but boring. It's not his fault, his acting is fine, but it's like they gave up on his character midway and just had him react to the two leads instead of having a strong character of his own. He's a metaphor for the rest of this drama, It's like they gave up on everything midway.Would I watch this again? No. It was fine for one viewing, but the story just kept getting worse. By the last episode, I kept pausing out of frustration and the better scenes did not involve the leads. There werent enough good moments in this drama to make me want to sit through this ever again, although I did appreciate the episode that paid homage to Parasite. Plus the ending was a complete letdown and included one of THE MOST frustrating final episode tropes. They definitely tried to rush to tie loose ends, but the story still felt unfinished. I didnt care enough to want it to continue. In fact, it took me longer to finish this drama because I forgot I was watching it. The soundtrack is kinda cute. Also forgettable, but cute. Overall, this is not a horrible drama but its definitely a skippable one. I liked hearing the realistic savings and real estate tips, and getting a tour of some amazing Korean homes, and I appreciated Na Young Wons determination to own a home of her own, but as a romance this just isnt up to par. I dont even mind the date your boss clich, but at least do the clich justice. As an office comedy its decent, but not LOL funny. The theme about what makes a home and the frustrations that come with securing a home was a good concept, but these stories didnt get me to invest emotionally into it. This was definitely a dish that looked good on the menu but was unimpressive once I took a bite. I wouldnt order it again or recommend anyone else eat it, unless youre just hungry for anything, then his may assuage your hunger in the meantime. I guess I should have use a ""home"" analogy... umm...  This drama is a home in a nice neighborhood that seems perfect for you initially but once you move in you realize how in desperate need of repairs it is, but you will make the best out of it for now until you can find a better place to live and can finally move on. Im ready to move to a better drama home."

Visually stunning scenes. Emotionally intense at times, too  Frankly, I'm not a fan of shallow, adolescent love stories. (Not necessarily because they are not good, but I guess I am too old by now. The topics are not mine anymore.)  I'm interested in somewhat more complex, mature characters and differentiated relationship studies - preferably in an distinctive (Korean) context with additional historical, cultural or subcultural insight.""Moon Lovers - Scarlet Heart Ryeo"" originally goes back to a Chinese story. The movie adaptation was a great success and so here comes a Korean remake - the plot is unceremoniously moved to the Goryeo of the 12th century and a controversial historical ruler is portrayed on that occasion: the 4th son of the founder of the Wang dynasty (who ruled the Goryeo Empire for over 400 years) King Gwangjong, born under the name Wang So (925-975).----------------------- SIDE NOTE ---  King GwangjongSome historical sources have led to the interpretation that he was a right-wing tyrant, but more recent evidence suggests that he implemented the major reforms that laid the foundation for a solid kingdom for more than 4 centuries. This character has also appeared several times in KDrama, for example in ""Taejo Wanggun"" (2000), ""The Dawn of the Empire"" (2002), ""Empress Chunchu"" (2009), ""Shine or Go Crazy"" (2015) or here: ""Moon Lovers - Scarlet Heart Ryeo"" (2016).Wang So had three older brothers (Wang Mu, Wang Tae, Wang Yo), 20 half brothers and 7 half sisters. From this, one can firstly see that he was not actually considered for the line of succession, and secondly suspect that King Taejo kept several wives at court. As life goes, all three older brothers died for different reasons and in the end the crown accidentally fell at Wang So's feet.After a turbulent period of 3 kings in quick succession, King Gwangjong re-established a stable, centralized government with a strong, loyal army and 7 peaceful years before the aristocracy rebelled against his reforms (which came at their expense). One of his innovative reforms concerned slave ownership, which he had officially checked for legality. When in doubt, the slaves became free people and taxpayers (while their former masters began to lose influence...) However, putting down this rebellion of aristocracy  earned him the reputation of a bloody tyrant.Another reform was the introduction of a national civil service examination, which lasted for almost 950 years. This replaced the pure nepotism previously practiced in filling political offices with performance and ability. At the same time he laid the basis for Confucianism as a principle of social order. He also introduced a dress code at court, from which the respective rank could be read from the colors.King Gwangjong married his half-sister and two nieces. This is unique in Goryeo's history, as it was more common at court to marry outside of the bloodline in order to gain allied lordships. Gwangjong, on the other hand, relied on a strong, purely royal bloodline. After all, he ruled for 26 years and set the course for the next 400 or so.-----------------------------------------------------Back to the KDrama. Unfortunately, the plot that was spun around this dazzling historical king and his family is a bit shallow and predictable at times. Sometimes it reminded me of a harmless, colorful teenage boarding school flirtation. (I obviously don't quite correspond to the target age group there...) But then, furthermore, the story offers unexpected depth and emotionally touching scenes, too. After all, it also comes along with some exciting and visually stunning sequences and an atmospheric soundtrack. I initially ended up there for actress IU in the first place. In fact, I discovered Lee Joon-gi (as Wang So) in this KDrama. In my eyes it is his down-to-earth charisma (and maturity?) that helps to overcome some weaknesses in the script.An attractive dramaturgically dynamic component is the leap in time, through which the approximately 20-year-old Go Ha-jin (IU) suddenly ends up at the court of the royal Wang family - in the midst of the numerous sons and half-sons of King Teajo... As a woman from the future, she brings fresh air and a cheeky spirit into everyday palace life, which is characterized by distrust and intrigues. The various mothers are prepared to do almost anything in order to secure a royal career for their precious princes. At the same time, the modern Ha-jin in her idiosyncratic way brings the blue blood of the king's sons (some of whom are still quite pubescent) to a boil, thus providing additional competition among the boys on top of the already existing succession rivals ....A nice, charming, entertaining, but rather lightweight KDrama-tour into Korean history."

It isn't horrible but there is nothing special about it either.  The premise of the story is excellent.  There is secret power that brings happiness and everything you ever wanted protected by the good guys against evil.  There are birth secrets and the question if love and friendship conquers all.  Sounds great, but the execution was just so blah.  The dialog leaves a lot to be desired and there is just something missing.  I think the chemistry between the actors is fine, but I didn't really care about what happened to any of the characters like I feel I should have.  The ending was good though.  I actually increased my rating because I liked how they ended it.

Whether you will like it or not, depends all on whenever you will like the characters and their interactions.Its another show about a confident jerk male lead and a nice and madly in love female lead who is willing to get dumped countless times and still cannot give up on the dude. What is surprising, though: they are both somehow likable (many would disagree, so don't quote me on that). I wanted to slap Soo back to reality more than once, but I also loved all his scenes and found him to be an interesting character. Woo Yeon, even though desperate with her unrequited love, still seemed like a strong character that is slowly gaining more confidence and learning how to put herself first. The flaws were presented in a way that made me curious about the development, rather than annoyed with their current state.The show is full of cliches, but I was weirdly not mad about them at all. I saw these plotlines in other dramas, I should be bored, but somehow I wasnt. Why? Because I cared for these characters. I was emotionally attached to them and was genuinely interested in their stories.I also have to appreciate they at least tried to give a better explanation for Soo being such a selfish jerk. It wasnt just random, short conversations we usually get in dramas to explain the behavior. His past was mixed well in the overall plot and, even though it did not excuse his actions, it made me understand him more.They took a similar approach with Woo Yeon. While she was a weak person in terms of her love life and the desperation she presented, she also was strong and striving to achieve her dreams. She wasnt weak in all areas of her life. She was flawed in one. And that made her an interesting character.The chemistry between all the characters was amazing. Not only romance felt natural, but also the friendship between the main and supporting cast. Nothing felt forced or unrealistic. Great acting from the cast for sure helped achieve that.The sub-plots were also interesting, with 2 supporting couples bringing something different to the table. We got comedy and we got melo. Such a striking difference, but even when their scenes were one right after another, it never felt disconnected or like they belonged to different shows. The flow and transitions were just right.For me it was just a fun romantic comedy that had a good amount of sub plot surrounding the main one. Nothing felt like useless fillers for me (though I am sure many people would disagree).Do I think this drama could have been shorter? Sure. I honestly believe getting 12 and not 16 episodes would be ideal, but I have exactly the same opinion about ALL romantic comedies. They are just not meant for a longer format. The last 4 episodes were painfully full of cliches. I'm pretty sure I saw my brain a few times when I rolled my eyes so hard. That said, I am unable to name even one rom-com that avoided cliches at the end. I think it's just given and expected in the genre.Overall, if you cannot get over the over-confident male lead that is extremely selfish most of the time and desperate for his love female lead, this aint for you. The characters are far more than the flaws, and I myself found them likable, but if these are your personal pet peeves, you will not like it."

Up to episode 75 it was like watching and waiting for something to drop.  To explain further we have all seen those series that have mysteries or secrets attached to the lives of its characters. Theres nothing wrong with them however Im absolutely not a fan of drawn out reveals. Its almost not interesting for me because I know when the reveal takes place everything shifts so I spend the entire time waiting for the turning point which I know is coming. Sadly for this series the reveal took place after 75 episodes out of 100 to and its still not completely revealed. The supporting cast characters were absolutely annoying.  the older sisters character was rude and inconsiderate and her husband behaved so much like a teenager that you only cringed when there were things with him in it. And I sincerely mean Cringe.  his behavior was so immature that it was absolutely unrealistic for his age, it was extreme. the younger sisters character was immature as well. It sincerely seem to me that the supporting cast characters were severely immature and  it teetered on the line of tantrums and spoil brats. The supporting cast of characters someone set the life out of the series not to mention its 100 episodes. There are almost no peaceful moments within the series.  I am convinced that this drama is 90% tension, 4% romance I am 6% weirdness. If you like dramas that are packed with the drama and nothing more  this might be a perfect thing for you however if youre looking for a blend of family, drama and romance this is absolutely not it. Be warned because you can get hooked on the middle sisters storyline but the supporting cast characters almost makes it not worth it. By episode five I started  to fast forward through the scenes with the younger sister, but episode 30 I was annoyed with the older sisters husband. These two have the emotional capacity of a teenager that was going through a life crisis. Absolutely weird and toooo much."

His whole logic for winning and paying the debt was to protect Jin Won and be able to keep running with him (as he ""passionately"" screamed at his face in the last episode)... but then he just left? LoGiC.Jin Won with the whole ""go buy yourself proper new running shoes"" when Sang Ha already told him he is running early mornings to deliver milk, because he ain't got money, but he needs to pay the debt. Something didn't click right in Jin Won's brain I guess. Not to mention that punch in the last episode. WHERE THE HECK IT CAME FROM? Not once they hinted that Jin Won might be a one to react aggressively with physical force. And here he is punching a kid in the face. This is called bad writing, ladies and gentlemen.The debt storyline was truly the worst part that ruined the whole show for me. Why they couldn't keep it simple with a sweet romance is beyond me. The debt collectors went from punching the kid in the face, to crying when he finally paid it off, giving some bullshit, out of place, emotional reaction. Not to mention, apparently in Korea, when your parents die when you are in middle school, you don't go to an orphanage or foster family. You are left alone to deal with it... Go figureIt had some cute moments, I'm not gonna lie, but instead of watching the whole show, you could watch the highlights on youtube. Even the last scene had to be ruined by making them run in semi formal clothes ON A DATE. We get it, they are runners. Damn the writers... Why?Get rid of the debt angst story, use the few minutes you gained to develop the relationship a bit more, and it would be easily 9/10 for me."

Edit Translation  English 한국어 中文(简体) Русский","Byun Yo Han, Kim Gab Soo, Kim Min Jung, Kim Tae Ri, Lee Byung Hun, Yoo Yeon Seok","Netflix,  tvN ","This KDrama is more like an epic movie that (fortunately) doesn't want to end over 24 episodes  ""Mr. Sunshine"" is pure epic! Visually stunning! Heartbreaking. With a fantastic cast! In addition, there is a vivid and at the same time gripping history lesson (dealing with the turn of the 19th / 20th centuriy). The KDrama is more like an epic movie that (fortunately) doesn't want to end over 24 episodes. Complex characters, interwoven developments with sudden twists, cinematic camera, unforgettable soundtrack, everything seems handpicked, nothing off the shelf. The budget was correspondingly high, but it isn't just good because it was expensive. Rather, it is made with a lot of love from front to back and down to the last detail. There are hardly familiar motifs that we have often seen in variation. Everything is precisely coordinated in all scale levels. The personal decisions that the protagonists make over and over again in the course of the story remain unpredictable until the end. Historically we learn about the relationship between Joseon and the Japanese, but also with the rest of the world. The story takes place before the country becomes a Japanese protectorate - in that brief window of time when Joseon (after a long period of isolation) became the Greater Korean Empire and then opened up to the rest of the world. For this reason, the USA also play a role in here, because the States - like Russia and Japan - are ready and waiting to get involved in the imperialist competition for the largest slices of the cake Joseon is offering. The country is rich in raw materials and therefore hot property. ""Mr Sunshine"" provides a vivid and gripping introduction to those geopolitical complications.------------------  SIDE NOTE --- Historic setting: Joseon and the rest of the world ...Since the 17th century, Joseon rather had itself isolated from the outside world. This rigorous attitude ultimately led to the first military confrontation between Joseon and the USA, which marks the kick off point to the plot of ""Mr. Sunshine"". In 1866, an American ship, the SS Sherman, entered Korean waters via the Taedong River. Since it did not turn around immediately when asked, there were violent arguments in which the ship was ultimately set on fire. This was followed in 1871 by the battle off the island of Ganghwa-do, in which the USA wanted to rescue the survivors of the shipwrecked crew and at the same time establish the first prerequisites for trade relations. However, since the desired diplomatic gesture of the Korean apology did not happen to take place, the Joseon garrison on the island was radically wiped out by the American warships and their crew. This first conflict with the USA went down in history as 'Shinmiyangyo'.King Gojong came to the throne in 1873 and, in contrary to previous national policy, decided to open up his country in the hope of flourishing trade and technical innovation. Japan pushed ahead and forced the Japanese-Korean friendship treaty of 1876 on the king, including military pressure, too. However, this was a contract between unequal friends... In the course of the international processes that had been initiated, King Gojong also sought contact and trade agreements with Western countries. ---------------------------------------------During this time, ""Mr. Sunshine"" stages its main plot, in which protagonist Eugene, as US officer of loathed Korean descent, is supposed to sensitively, competently and diplomatically represent the interests of the USA with a consular mandate. But there is always more life has to offer... Eugene has to meet the love of his life, face his roots and reconsider his values in life. He cant help it: he has to take a stand... It is said that not everything is historically 100 percent precise, but the historical circumstances provide plenty of material for pure epic drama at its finest. Thrilling. Unforgettable."

The first half of this show is a lets-pretend-we-are-saviours-of-the-poor-downtrodden-unfortunates. The second half is is the usual predictable gangster/corruption stuff. The script totally smacks of being written by someone who has zero understanding of what they are writing about. Everything from the emotions the characters are required to exhibit to the conversations that they have is totally unrealistic and wide of the mark. The gangsters are caricatures and theres a lot of cringeworthy faux laughing. The plot and actors lines were so predictable that I was almost saying it with themactually I did say it with them on a number of occasions. Theres a credibility gap as wide as ten ton truck in the way they behave. Dressed in plain clothes, they never identify themselves as police, but just wade into fist fights on every possible occasion, randomly throwing in a few gunshots without warning. Not only that, but so many fragments of plot around the FLs family hang off the edges of the main action like flailing fish and there is no credible character development. Son Ho Jun as Han Jin Woo simply looked embarrassed about being in the show at all. All the other characters had one mode of being and acted it out from beginning to end because they had no choice. Im a real fan of Kim Hee Ae and that was why I picked up the show. But this is not one of her best performances. All I can think is that this was the show where director Ahn Gil Ho learned from his mistakes, because Watcher and Stranger are light years ahead of this drama. But he had different writers to work with on those productions and, well, it really shows.OK, its Sunday night bland entertainment, with nothing except fantasy-land porridge to offer. Was there anything to like about it? I think like is a bit strong The OST made no impact on me whatsoever. The other production values were uninspiring and perfunctory.

I usually binge on Kdramas if they keep me interested but I found myself watching maybe about 2 episodes a day because of the slowness at times.In my opinion the series picked up about the 13th episode but it kind of fizzled on the last episode.Coming up on my 1 year anniversary of watching Kdramas I've learned how the episodes work. I've enjoyed a lot and dropped a few. I was going to drop this one but I gave it the benefit of the doubt.There are about 4 cast members from both series which I loved. From the comments on those who watched both series but enjoyed the second cast better than the first I will have to say I liked all of the casts from both seasons. Each brought their own style and everybody could fight which was even better. There wasn't a weak one in the bunch like the usual. I liked the two cops who were always partnered together. The female was strange but I liked her because she was tough. I also liked the fact that there wasn't that fluffy romance that makes me want to grab a hurl bag. I hate that kind of stuff and that didn't happen here.I got tired of the main bad guy real quick. The constant grinning got on my everlasting nerve! I remember him from Hidden Identity and couldn't stand the 'I don't care' facial expression. I know he can't help the way he look but I wasn't too fond of him in either series.Both Mrs. Cop 1 & 2 held their own. The premise was almost the same but it carried differently which still worked.The last episode just didn't do it for me. I don't know what I was expecting but there was too much fluff and the closure I was expecting happened real fast towards the very end.Even still, this drama filled my void for a few days.

What's worse, her benefactor stabs her in the back. Things are closing in on her, but she's not the type of person who gives up. Let's find out how she comes up against the harsh reality of life!(Source: KBS World) ","Cho Yeo Jung, Go So Young, Kim Bo Min, Kim Jung Nan, Sung Joon, Yoon Sang Hyun",KBS2,"I'm not sure what made me watch this drama until the end since I hated it from the beginning. If you aren't sold by episode one, just know that the plot only gets more ridiculous. My issue was that I didn't like 95% of the characters, which makes it hard to like the show obviously, but there was just enough suspense and a main character that peaked my curiosity enough to make me want to keep watching, and that's Jo Yeo Jung as ""Ms. Perfect"" herself.

I think Jo Yeo Jung was perfect (pun intended lol) in the role. She was the perfect balance of sweet and sinister to make her an interesting character, so I kept watching to see what her story would be. The more her story was revealed the more clich and uninterested I became. Then her crazy manic stare would pull me back in. I wish she was who the story focused on, but the real center of the drama was Go So Young as Shim Jae Bok. I did not like her character, and It was hard to sympathize with her the more the show went on. I think the point was to create a strong character who was no nonsense, but instead she came across as super critical, extra paranoid, and in a constant bad mood for 20 episodes. Reading the synopsis I see what the plot was going for, but I think it failed because the main character never changes. Because she was such a negative neurotic nancy, her one note paranoia throughout the show got old quick, and was frustrating to watch. It also made it hard to see her in any romantic situation, including the one they tried to force with Sung Joon. It the beginning they had a banter that was ok to watch, but it lead to zero romantic chemistry. You know it's bad when the romantic climax is hugging it out. 

Jae Bok also has a crew of female friends who are THE most obnoxious and nosey bordeline frienemies. I guess they were there for comic relief, but I was just annoyed by their bitterness and catty behavior. Even the kid Che-ri came off as a brat. I wanted to skip all scenes involving them. 

Most of the supporting cast is pretty terrible honestly... but I will at least give the two main kids a pass. 

The most disappointing character was Jung Hee played by Yoon Sang Hyun. I've loved him in so many dramas, and this is the first time I can remember being annoyed by his role and his performance. He played an over the top version of a passive character and then suddenly switched completely in a way I found to be completely unrealistic. Bad writing meets bad acting was a continuous theme for me throughout the show.

The story tries to be a suspense comedy with a makjang plot, and it just didn't work for me. The characters were mostly one dimensional and unrealistic. Characters who should have been gone reappeared, and main characters appeared out of nowhere. The plot was so ridiculously random that it was if they were making up things as they went along. They did manage to create enough suspense to keep me wondering wtf was going on, but the reveals were always disappointing. The cheesy ending tried it's best to tie all loose ends, but I was just relieved that it was finally over. I guess it's obvious that a rewatch is out of the question, unless I just want to confirm how bad it was for a second time. 

Overall I kinda wish Jo Yeo Jung had her own Ms. Perfect spinoff, with a better cast, writer, and director involved (this was directed by the director of Mary Stayed Out All Night - which I liked only half a point more). Instead this drama is far from perfect. It's also way too repetitive to be 20 episodes long. If makjang is your genre of choice, you may be more forgiving of this show's flaws than I was, but I couldn't recommend this drama to anyone otherwise.  

You know things are bad when the only character you sympathize with and are rooting for is the villain."

Not that I was a hopeless romantic, to begin with. I mean, I can tolerate romance in bite-size portions but not when it's being force-fed in nearly every scene while forcing the rest of the series to take a backseat as if nothing else of consequence is happening. Then I came across Ms. Temper &Nam Jung Gi (titled My Horrible Boss on Netflix) and decided I would take a chance. I'm so glad I did.From the moment I saw Yo Won Lee, I was hooked. There was no turning back. She is the default, strong-female-lead who feels no need to apologize to the world of men for being a woman. Her character, Ms. Ok, may struggle--popularity-wise--against the seemingly endless stream of subordinate, submissive, and co-dependent types of female leads that readily appear throughout all of Asian television, but the fact that shows like Ms. Temper... were even produced gives me hope that times ""are a-changin'"".I really loved the fact that romance was not the priority in this K-drama but that the leads were allowed to let their attraction to each other happen more naturally. The supporting cast was excellent as well. I would definitely recommend watching this show if you're a fan who values quality--great story that's easy to digest, great performances and a real demonstration of ""girl power"" --over quantity--stacking the deck with eye candy in the hopes of distracting away from a cookie cutter romance that ultimately defeats the theme of the show. Strong woman? I don't think so."

I happened to discover this web drama while I'm trying to look for the next thing to watch and I'm glad I did. I am a big fan of dramas that is related to DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) or Multiple Personality Disorder. It's a subject that really interests me.This is a just short web drama that has very few casts but I really loved it. The plot is intriguing and the character portrayal is superb specially for the female lead who portrays different identities. To be honest  even without the color switching, I would still recognize if the alter suddenly changed.To dive deeper, this web drama doesn't have a single plot that they are following. Each episode has an idea of it's own however they do share a linear timeline. The first episode made sense for the rest of the episodes. Of there's just a minor setback for me, it's the fact that the DID case on this one is not as realistic as other shows I have watched. Throughout the series there were times wherein the alters shared a part of a memory of a different alter. Real DID patients have separate memories. It also mentioned that her sister made the personalities. In reality, you won't be able to control what kind of alters you'll have.Technicalities aside, it was fun watching and is definitely a bite-size kind of drama. So I recommend this to be watched during breaks or while waiting on something."

Actually, I was not going to write a review for this drama but then I noticed that there weren't any so I might as well jott down a few of my impressions. I just love this kind of fantasy and this one has an novel way to work with time!It is a story of a young woman who, on the eve of becoming twenty, categorically refuses to buy a packet of chewing gum from a bizarre looking woman. Little does she know that that woman is a witch who goes on to curse her, as a repercussion, to remain 20 forever. So on every New Year, the girl's life gets reset and everything she'd done gets deleted: her family and friends do not know her anymore. Everything starts to change when , twenty years later, she meets her first love's doppelganger, creates solid connections with old and new friends and finally finds the witch again.As you can see, I loved the story. The writing was good and I found it rather convincing since the initial set up was very complicated (time passes for everyone except for her) . She becomes a forty year old woman inside a twenty year old body but still references things from the first time that she was 20 leaving people around her flabbergasted! The drama is funny and sweet. The actors were OK, nothing to write home about, they emoted enough but acting was obviously not their cup of tea. They were easy on the eye so the lack of acting chops are to be overseen since the story is fun to watch even without fireworks. Actually, the FL had better chemistry with the SML, as usual but the ML was cute as a brooding button! One of the most interesting characters was the witch: over the top scary make up who eventually gets sick with Alzheimer's but manages to find a few sane moments to sort the FL out.I did not like the witch very much because of the way they presented her: such a clich when they could have done something more subtle and therefore scarier! All in all, they managed to keep the second hand embarrassment to a strict minimum: though it was a bit difficult to believe that the FL was not at ease with all the internet speak: it sometimes seemed she was stuck in time, as if she did not follow the societal evolutions over those twenty years of being 20! Koreans are definitely very creative when they deal with time problems: be it time slip, time travel, time curse, groundhog day! I am just so happy to have discovered K-dramas because they do not seem to be afraid of any complicated subject and time is very very complicated."

Until, that is, she encounters the most unusual ghost she has ever met!This ghost is named Song Ji Chan, and until he was suddenly killed in an accident, he was the arrogant heir to a highly successful and wealthy business group. The accident, he thinks, has robbed him of his memories and leaves him hanging around the scene, wondering what has happened. But when he comes across Jung Se Ri, she tells him that he is a ghost. She leaves him to get his head around what has happened, but he follows her home, insisting he has nowhere else to go. She reluctantly lets him stay at her house, and even starts to help him uncover the truth about what happened to him – even if it means she has to become involved in the business group’s operations! But could this ghoulish “roommate” also fall for the only woman who can see him?(Source: Viki)","Jung Chan Woo, Kim So Won",,"Could have been an interesting story but the execution failed.  My Chilling Roommate is about a girl who can see spirits and a ""ghost"" who clings to her while trying to figure out his identity. First, I have to say that the ghost trio stole the show.  Even though they irritated me, they are what made this show memorable.  And while Jung Chan Woo is a nice visual for the drama, it seemed to me that show was trying to use his idol power to sell itself.  The camera spent way too much time focusing on his face instead of moving forward with the story.   I was truly disappointed by this drama.  I usually enjoy ghost themes, but this one had too many directing and production flaws to make it enjoyable.  Although some of the characters were ""ghosts"" (souls, ghosts, and demons), they werent the only ones that seemed disconnected.  The dialogue and acting of most of the cast was amateurish. Couple that with sudden melodramatics, and it makes the story have no depth.  Its like watching a university stage-play. However, the interviews at the end of the episodes are amusing, and showed much better, more natural acting.  And the fact that there were in-character interviews shows imagination. The in-drama music seemed displaced. It was more distracting than mood-setting, often being too loud.  The intro/outro song and the final song were appropriate and to my liking though.The director for this drama is credited for several short-length dramas with a fairly narrow cast selection.  Better budget, lengthier episodes, and more talented supporting actors would definitely help with creating better shows."

The context is General Yi Song-gye, who for the next approximately 5 centuries tied the throne to his bloodline with a coup d'etat. However, this KDrama isnt a history lesson as such, though historical figures get involved. Also romance is not the predominant matter. ... First and foremost it's about loyalty, unconditional male friendship and love as its basis. Secondly, it is about relationships between fathers and sons. Thirdly it is about romantic love, too. Besides and as a backbone for the storylines dramatic dynamics it its about political attitudes, visionary leaders and the throne. Overall, ""My Country - The New Age"" is definitely worth seeing, yet you should be prepared for makjang-like emotional roller coasters.The actors significantly contribute to the intensity of the story. Above all, the charisma of Jang Hyuk as Lee Bang-won (the 5th son of General Yi and later 1st Joseon King), as well as Ahn Nae-sang as Nam Jeon (the historical Jong Do-jeon and chief chancellor), who both set the political, administrative and legal course for a blossoming Joseon Empire.----------------- SIDE NOTE: --- Lee Bang-won (later King Taejong) and Jong Do-jeon (first chief chancellor of the Joseon aera) ---These two crucial historical personalities (Lee Bang-won and Jong Do-jeon) were both driving forces in those early years of the new empire with quite lasting impact, and at their time fundamental adversaries.Jong Do-jeon as the first Joseon Kings chief chancellor decided all matters relating to military affairs, diplomatic procedures, questions of education, new legislation and constitution (the once feudal state was now organized in a bureaucratic manner), new tax laws as well as new state religion (Buddhism became Confucianism). He ultimately moved the capital to Hanyang (now Seoul). He also named the districts of Hanyang and the 8 provinces in the country and caused many slaves to be freed. He was a man with strong visions for an innovative political system in the new kingdom - and consequently implemented those (quite unscrupulously).His opponent was Yi Bang-won, who did not want an empire with ministers being more important than the king. Rather, he prefered a powerful monarch, a solidly grounded monarchy. He was also one of those who had contributed most to his father's successful coup detat. However, the latter had finally disappointed him by not choosing him as his successor. After the Queen's death, Bang-won took advantage of his father's period of mourning and invaded the palace. In doing so, he killed the state chancellor, all ministers loyal to him and the children of the deceased queen as well as the crown prince, too. So he (also) took the throne by force - his father could only abdicate and reluctantly hand over the crown. However, as King Taejong, Bang-won effectively contributed to a stable system of government in his own way. Among other things, he enacted a law allowing all citizens to register and established new Ministries: of Human Resources, Finance, Protocol, Defence, Justice and Public Affairs.----------------------------------------------------------The KDrama paints a strong picture of these two crucial early Joseon men as their actors live their roles with high intensity. We get to know more about their character in their respective relationships with the two protagonists Seo Hwi, son of a once-legendary soldier of the Goryeo Empire, and Nam Sun-ho, the illegitimate son by Minister Nam Joen. Since childhood they are best friends. Then there is a twist of fate. (Here, again: two actors with splendid performance - Yang Se-jong and Woo Do-hwan.) Minister Nam Jeon alone is responsible for the twist of fate in this friendship, but Prince Bang-won becomes a free rider in this. In short: ""My Country: The New Age"" offers an epic, visually stunning story with a lot of action and emotion, worth seeing sword fights (actor Jang Hyuk does the stunts all by himself), plenty of blood and even more emotion. Yes, of course there are also women and love involved ... The abundance of (epic) tragedy is KDrama at its finest."

It wasn't predictable by any means, and they didn't miss a beat in keeping the suspense and drama rolling. I think my chief complaint for the story is the backstory/ motivations for the characters.

It's like Veep meets Brooklyn99 with a little (very little) kdrama romance added in. The problem is if I look at this show comparing it to those american works it falls short. Sure it's supposed to be a political/crime comedy, but it's not really that funny most of the time.  If I look at it expecting intricate plots & interesting procedural proceedings it just doesn't deliver, that said korean political thriller? shows almost always suck. The story is really bad, with so many plotholes that you could drain the ocean with them. When a comedy show doesn't take itself very seriously & it's really funny I can ignore the bad plot, but that's not the case here and it does try take itself quite seriously at times, in an inconsistent manner. They've spent the entire first episode setting up the main leads & then their joint life kind of fades into the background, bad rewrites perhaps?It's not all bad though, like there is a little ""Catch Me If You Can"" vibe at times and both female leads were quite good. I couldn't help but notice that Lee Yoo-young's eyes are very unique looking!

I am not going to tell the story, but it is a lovely storytelling Kdrama to watch with strong performance by the lead actress Shin Hae Sun and actor Park Shi Hoo. The main female character, Seo Ji Ahn (portrayed by actress Shin Hae Sun) is a struggling part-time employee and intern that has an on-and-off love relationship with the third generation conglomerate Choi Do Gyung (portrayed by Park Shi Hoo). Do Gyung exudes strongly a third generation chaebol character that was born with a silver spoon in his mouth flawlessly. I cannot imagine other actress or actor to play these two leading female and male characters. They look good together on-screen and convincingly interpret their characters; they show their raw emotion and inner turmoil  so well. The audience will be able to palpate Ji Ahn depression and her will to get back on her feet again. Also, the audience is able to feel the will of Do Gyung to be worthy of Ji Ahn's love.I do not see any on-screen chemistry between the other leading characters Sun Woo Hyuk (portrayed by Lee Tae Hwan) and Seo Ji Soo (portrayed by Seo Eun Soo). Woo Hyuk seems to be not interested in the lovely Ji Soo from the beginning to the end. Woo Hyuk did so well in the initial episodes when the character runs away from adoring Ji Soo, but he has a hard time to interpret the character Woo Hyuk that is in love with Ji Soo in the subsequent episodes. His expression does not show any inclination toward loving Ji Soo. He tries hard but does not deliver.I really enjoy the secondary supporting characters Seo Ji Ho (portrayed by Shin Hyun Soo) and Choi Seo Hyun (portrayed by Lee Da In), they almost steal the show. However, the strong performance by actress Shin Hae Sun and actor Park Shi Hoo save the day and our focus is still glued to the painful Ji Ahn and Do Gyung on-and-off love story.I find the character Seo Ji Tae is made for actor  Lee Tae Sung, the actor fits so well to play as the first son of Seo family and an Oppa/Hyeong to his siblings. I do like these following characters , firstly, Kim Ki Jae [Do Gyung's best friend) character, he is truly a devil advocate friend of Do Gyung; secondly, Lee Yong Gook [Dorm owner]  character is a guardian angel for Do Gyung; last but not least, Secretary Yoo [Do Kyung's secretary] is a real soul mate of Do Gyung. These three friends are always there to guide and comfort Do Gyung through his ""angst"". Salute to actors Kim Sa Kwon, Kim Sung Hoon and Lee Gyu Bok that work as catalysts in this wonderful story and keep the story going.As usual all the veteran actors Chun Ho Jin and Jeon Noh Min and actresses Kim Hye Ok and  Na Young Hee show strong performance as the parents of Ji Ahn and Do Gyung.  However, when  Seo Tae Soo (portrayed by the great Chun Ho Jin) is angry and depressed, and lives in his parent' hometown, it feels like he is throwing tantrums. But Seo Tae Soo comes back strong when he saves Choi Do Gyung and his company. He works as a catalyst to keep the story moving. The original sounds tracks are excellent and I would give a nine-out-of-ten for ""My Golden Life"". I am incline to give a five-out-of-ten for re-watch value because ""My Golden Life"" is a storytelling Kdrama and re-watching it may diminish the charm of the story. But do not take my word for it."

This drama started out promoting a very promising message but unfortunately, soon fell flat. Since I am not a fan of puppy love I didn't pick this up for the romance. I wanted to see our female lead's journey through bullying and how she conquers it. But apparently, her boy conquers for her.  I feel a bit robbed cause I kept waiting for the character development that never came. Regardless, it's a cute drama and you gotta give it effort for picking up a topic as controversial as plastic surgery. The actors are cute too and they did a good job. The best arc was probably done for the antagonist and soon she became the only interesting person on screen.It's unclear what the core message of this drama really is. Is it promoting plastic surgery? (lol) Is it teaching self-love? Is it telling us that beauty is on the inside and  self-acceptance is the key to happiness?I would really like to know but sadly the show's focus soon turned on being your every other basic neighborhood love story and stayed there.  So yikes.A fairly enjoyable drama, nonetheless.  Watch it if you don't want anything too serious."

Unbeknownst to him, he will not be left in peace.~~ Based on the original webtoon “Dongnebyunhosa Jodeulho / 동네변호사 조들호” by Hatchling.(Source: HanCinema) ","Byun Hee Bong, Choi Seung Kyung, Go Hyun Jung, Jo Dal Hwan, Lee Min Ji, Park Shin Yang",KBS2,"Where do I begin.  First and foremost, the exceptional, amazing and powerful acting from two of the best actors of K-dramas, Park Shin Hye and Ko Hyun Jung.  It's seldom to watch a drama with a female villain and in that sense this made the story unique.  Ko Hyun Jung's character, Im Jung Hee embraced the dark side to avenge the unbearable tragedy brought upon her and her sibling as part of a group of children  living in a welfare centre.   I was mesmerized by KHJ's acting as she wielded power over everyone around her.  She was soft spoken, hardly raised her voice and yet, behind her smile  one can sense a seething anger and the promise of a tragic ending for anyone who dared to cross her path.   She was highly intelligent and used that intelligence and cunning to break her enemies and in several instances, outsmart Lawyer Jo.The other half of this powerhouse couple was Lawyer Jo Deul Ho, the friendly neighbourhood lawyer.  He was on the right side of the law,  fighting for the poor and downtrodden.  His disheveled appearance and questionable approach to hygiene aside, he happened to be a brilliant lawyer,  totally devoted to his clients and dedicated to uncovering the truth like a dog with a bone.  I can only describe Park Shin Hye's acting with one word, outstanding.Together, PSH and KHJ made the drama addicting, gripping and spellbinding.  This was for me, more character driven as both Lawyer Jo and Jung Hee used everything in their power to outdo and outwit one another so that the story  became secondary.   I'm surprised that season 2 did not garner higher ratings than season 1.  Season 1 was ok but forgettable and the main lead actress' poor acting ability was blatantly obvious every time she's onscreen with PSH.Overall, if you like crime thrillers that this drama has in spades and magnificent acting, I highly recommend this drama."

Mi Jung, the youngest and most timid Yeom sibling, decides to approach him.","Chun Ho Jin, Kim Ji Won, Lee El, Lee Ki Woo, Lee Min Ki, Son Seok Koo, Son Suk Ku","jTBC, Netflix","Progressive Message: Quality of life increases with the degree of truthfulness (not scham&pretence)  ""My Liberation Notes"" is a ray of hope within South Korean series production. In short: The lives of  young people in their prime (+/- 30) are at stake here. Considering their groaning under the pressure of the competition in the workplace, the dazzling promises of the modern lifestyle industry, and the claims of society and family traditions, this could all be pretty depressing. But amazingly, it's not. The protagonists manage to give their lives something like dignity - quietly, impressively and with gentle intensity. They walk the way that lies before them, spraying their personal touch, a little bit, but nicely, thus leaving color and warmth on their trail.The KDrama presents itself as a Netflix co-production and is thus in a certain way 'pimped' for an international audience - you don't see anything of the typical and rather special elements like makjang, slapstick, glitter & glamor of Jaebeol, or traumatic childhood secrets. Just life, every day, like everywhere else. Without spectacular ups and downs. As if someone had blindly reached into a pot full of addresses from a random location on the outskirts of metropolitan Seoul and then simply turned the spotlight and camera on the family living there for a while. In principle, it could be any family living near the terminal stations of the Seoul subway network. This, however, identifies the KDrama as specifically South Korean. Finally, the story is high KDrama quality, when it comes to a carefully, multi-layered narrative with deliberately reduced pace and  space for the sensitive moments in between.----------------- SIDE NOTE: --- Provincial life in the metropolitan area around the capital Seoul ---So the KDrama simply tells about the normal life of relatively normal people around 30. They don't live in the megacity of Seoul (while almost 10 million people do) or in Incheon (with almost 3 million inhabitants), but in the sprawling province of Gyeonggi-do, which makes up the majority of the metropolitan area around Seoul in terms of space. The provincial population makes up ca half of the population of the more than 25 million inhabitants of the entire agglomeration around the capital Seoul. (And this in fact is about half of the inhabitants of South Korea altogether). An insight into the living environment of those provincial residents thus also offers an insight into a good deal of current South Korean life issues. The fictional 'Dangmi Station' is actually Line 1's 'Seonghwan Station'. Crucially, most people who work in Seoul (increasingly) cannot afford to live in the city. Every workday they commute about +/- 2 hours to do their job in the city. With the evening company dinners and collegial come-togethers, a day becomes very long. There isn't much time left for a life of your own outside of work. While it is convenient in many respects to remain in the family home until marriage, this further reduces the amount of free time you have at your disposal. Especially if the parents still do a bit of farming and the help of the 'children' is required here and there. City and country clash, almost every day. Accordingly, different life plans collide, which either fit more into a fast-paced, hip city life or rather into a rural, decelerated provincial life. In reality, however, new hybrid variants are needed that function as a flexible joint between both realities that are equally relevant to everyday life - city and country.You might want to think about the meaning of life. About goals that you would like to set for yourself. What is life? What does it offer me? What would I actually like to do? Or, wait a minute, is it better not to think at all? It is up to the young people of the recent and the following working generation, to grope, to stumble, to develop new, visionary as well as down to earth attitudes and inspiring blueprints to life in a South Korea from the 2020s onwards...------------------""My Liberation Notes"" sails in this field of tension. Other than that, tension is not on the agenda. ""My Liberation Notes"" is processing the wisdom, the questions and the insights that the protagonists come up with over the course of the story - sometimes quietly to themselves, sometimes in conversation with friends. The focus is on 4 protagonists who practically all live together in the provincial suburb of Seoul. Three of them are siblings and work in Seoul, the fourth is a stranger who helps their father in the carpentry shop and in the fields, eats with the family and lives next door. (A fantastic Son Seok-ko as an inscrutable stranger, as well as Lee Min-ki, Kim Ji-won and Lee-El as very different siblings, are presenting the range of everyday emotional worlds in a wonderfully haunting way.) All four wrestle with life in their very own manner and question, what freedom and quality of life could mean to them under the given circumstances. Promotion? Money? Success? A car? A partner? Marriage? Family? Living in an apartment in Seoul? Where is life? Is this life?Eventually the aspect of reverence also comes to the fore: To respect and be respected. To be worshipped. To be adored... Yet how to express mutual adoration and respect (in order for your own life to feel maybe a bit more valuable)? ... Maybe just give it more space. That would be great...The episodes pass as does life itself. The days are the same, and yet each one is new and different from the one before. Happiness is accumulated by the minute. And in the end, life is beautiful after all. Worth living. Distinctive. The quality increases with the degree of truthfulness that they give to their lives. And that's indeed a progressive message (as far as a society like the South Korean with its highly valued tradition of scham and pretence is concerned.)"

It's a 16 episode drama, but each episode is only about half an hour instead of a full hour long, so this one goes rather quickly and does not get dragged out. This is the first drama I've seen the male lead in - and I really enjoyed him a lot! He has a very cute smile and his character was pretty much a Mr. Perfect. He may have been a little bit shy and fumbled his way through learning to take care of a baby, which provided a lot of the comedy, but he was a very loyal and caring person. He had an amazing smile that just lit up the screen, and his interactions with Eun Ae (the baby) were just adorable. I felt like the female lead was a little on the weak side, which was kind of disappointing as I really enjoyed that actress in Let's Eat (btw, the actress that played her friend in that drama is a main actor in this one as well.) Oh Ji Ho as Cha Jeong Han totally carried this coupling. But overall, this was a quick, fun watch. The mom friends that he gained were so funny (especially Boem Soo's mom and her running joke through the series) and provided both comedy and obstacles to overcome. The last 2 episodes were very sweet and induced a few tears (happy ones!) The plot is very simple, but it is a really cute story and I would be willing to watch it all over again.

I was a bit skeptical about starting it but the soundtrack sounded nice and the cast was good so I gave it a try. Once I started it I could not stop watching it. In fact, it's been months since I marathoned a drama like I did with this one. However, I somehow think this will go on to be one of the lesser popular dramas irrespective of how good it was. I think it's definitely underrated and sadly it will not everyone's cup of tea.

What I liked about the story was how it incorporated all K-drama cliches from years before and presented  a nice, smooth story. The FEELS the drama gave me was immense. The main guy Ji Eun Ho has one of the purest loves ever in a kdrama. I loved how dedicated he was towards her and literally never thought of anyone apart from her, neither did he give up on their love. 

This is one of those dramas where you won't be sure whether it will be a happy end or a sad end. The story is kind of sad throughout and when I imagined a sad ending, I really thought it would be hell depressing. But the fun part here is you won't be sure how the leads will EVER manage to have a romance or a proper relationship with each other. Plus, there are a few mysteries which keep the story interesting.

The drama is very much an old school kdrama with star-crossed lovers and a whole lot of scheming and manipulations. It was seriously so entertaining. The splendid chemistry between the leads only increased my awe for it and not lessen it in any way. The soundtrack is pretty good too.

Like all kdramas ever, the last four episodes are sort of a drag and you might find yourself skipping some scenes. I liked the ending a lot. It fit in nicely with the story. I think I made a good decision watching it but I am not sure if I'll rewatch since I hardly ever do. Highly recommended if you like melodramas and pure love stories."

This is that show.Lee Sun-kyun plays Park Dong-hoon, a numb middle-aged engineer in a tired marriage who finds himself entangled with  Lee Ji-an, a very young, almost unsocialised woman played with an extraordinary subtlety and quiet intensity by IU.

Ji-an is a damaged young woman who has endured almost unimaginable tragedy but through her relationship with Dong-hoon they are both able to heal and to finally pursue happiness.The performances of the entire cast are extraordinary but it's the sparse script, off-kilter cinematography and haunting pensive OST that give the show a sensibility that's hypnotic, almost mesmerising. Its melancholic and a little weird  but in the kind of way that people are a little weird. Its grim and theres very little joy in it but the tone and lack of joy is presented in a way that makes it analogous to the disappointments and mindless drudgery of middle-age.But beyond the themes of failure and the cold darkness of winter as a metaphor for dissatisfaction, this is a show about the triumph of kindness. Portrayed so often as a weakness, it is instead Dong-hoon's kindness that is his greatest strength. It is kindness, community and love that is celebrated and through that celebration this show finds a beauty that transcends mere television. It is, for now, the best show of 2018."

I started watching this series after many episodes had aired because I noticed there was a total of 100 episodes in the series. I believe that the plot is good and the casting is great however the level of drama in this series is so extreme that it is annoying and frustrating. At first I was really liking it and could really get into it. There was the typical drama and crazy people but I was hopeful that eventually theyll get better but after 75 episodes of the 100 my hope is now gone. The evil characters are not only evil, theyre ridiculous, inhumane and without common sense. It could have been great but for me the drama overload killed it. I am aware that the series is about one mans past and his daughters future and how they are connected but How they chose to script that plot is so sour it hard to bare. imagine someone having a hard life their entire life. That is bad enough. Now lets imagine we add drama to someones already miserable life. Watching several episodes is like watching the downfall of somebody thats already on the ground. Imagine that person  being run over by a car then someone helping them up. After the person is on their feet they walk 4 feet and get robbed of all their valuables. This same person will walk five more feet and falls into a well.  The misery never ends. Now lets say that person is a humble mouse without a backbone who is verbally and emotionally abused. Dear goodness.  I liked the main couple however I really wish that the writers wouldve did a better job with this. The plot is good but there is absolutely no balance to this series. It is 100% drama, no romance, and no family bonding, no Mystery. Just pure unadulterated mess. Its like jerry springer meets Maury. Weve all seen the kdrama with the crazy in-laws, add that in too and they are extremely annoying. Its as if their characters are psychotic teens. Yes, that level.Please save yourself. Dont watch it unless you are a lover of drama overload. Im trapped now. Its like a train wreck and I cant look away. Ive invested in it and and still hope for damage control. There is zero happy moments, hundreds of grief moments and a few warm moments after 75 episodes."

Sometimes you just know it early on but this show keeps you guessing until the end. And even then, many fans were doubting it... waiting for some kind of plot twist. That's the sign of a good mystery where the audience isn't sure until the big reveal!I loved the time travel aspect of the show as well. Although they don't do too much of it but they have scenes of the male lead travelling in time to the future as well as the past. But the main setting is in the past. The town they created and the look and feel of 1987 was great!All the actors performed really well. Though Yoon Hae Jun's character feels a bit cold at times, he has depth and is frank with his thoughts and feelings. He also plans things out before acting. Baek Yoon Young is, in contrast, loud and rash. They make the perfect pair for the job they've set out for. I also loved the Baek brothers' plot line. It was quite touching with one of the episodes being a difficult watch. It was good insight into how things might have been for people at the time.The series also explores a lot of different relationships and family dynamics and how a moment in the past can have a ripple effect. This is the best aspect of My Perfect Stranger.You can expect some romance in sprinkles in several later episodes. Though there is no full blown romance, the chemistry between the leads is undeniable.

I think this is the 1st romcom, and fantasy with no past 1st love fate bs. and that made their love so much more endearing.they met, had a accidental tie down, lived together, saw each other's true selves and they fell in love, how normal and sweet is that?in the webtoon they seemed to imply a lee dam's brother x sunwoo's sister and I think that'd be hilarious and sad for them to make the 2ml her brother in law xDI didn't like some of the guys' reactions, their possessiveness, their tears, their clingyness, or the way jaejin x hyesun happened and also the way lee dam felt the need to apologize while Woo Yeo stayed quiet as if she needed to apologize, but overall the perfection of lee dam and the cuteness of Woo Yeo smiling when he didn't go through the writers ""we can't be together"" brooding mood, everything was perfect~tbh I hated all of the breakups and near deaths, I wish it was more like 49 days (minus the ending) where they had to collect tears of loveso like they could've done more things to make him feel human. I was more touched at Hye Sun's tears over Woo Yeo's return than anythingthough I was happy with the subtle change in his personality, like he got more carefree and dorky and my girl lee dam was always rational about itI like the ost enough and I actually rewatched some scenes for my article so I'll say I'll rewatch lee dam's hilarious comedies and the cute dates ;p"

I initially dropped this after the first episode, and against my better judgment decided to keep watching. The first episode looked cheap and sloppy. The dialogue was cheesy, also. It was just bad. 

The middle episodes were a bit better, but this was no great drama. It was still pretty cheesy, and the epilogues at the end of each episode were strange. They didn't add anything to the story at all. They were just basically little recaps. Episodes 11 and 12 could have been cut out almost completely. Episode 11 was basically all flashbacks and had zero plot movement. Episode 12 was a lot of the same. I'm not sure why they needed to stretch it out so far. Ten episodes could have wrapped this story up well. As for the romance, they didn't totally sell it to me as the characters were pretty shallowly developed. The two had a one night stand and didn't see each other again for three years, but yet he can't forget about her? She was a pretty weak lead honestly, and there wasn't anything so special about her that I bought that he was pining after her for three years. And the chemistry between the leads was only so-so. 

The music was ok, also nothing special. 

I wouldn't recommend this unless you were really hard up for rom-com. I fully admit that I only gave this show a second chance because I have a soft spot for Sung Hoon after his roles in Oh My Venus and Five Children. I was really hoping that he would have a great lead role in a rom-com, but this wasn't it. I feel bad for the actors of this.

Not really. I was not that interested in the Sang Shik and Jin Sook story, and it was the weakest part for me personally, as I was annoyed with some choices both of them were making.Overall, I have a feeling I might rewatch the show, or at least a few scenes this year.

I've given up hope of any improvement.  There are no longer any plot threads, just gimmicks to stretch it out longer.  I started it because I enjoyed Shim Yi Yeong in Want a Taste, which, as daily dramas go, wasn't awful - interesting characters and decent writing.  But I found that this was going to be a re-run of her character in that one, the beleaguered, unappreciated goody goody who takes care of everyone.  I should have quit at that point.  The characters in this drama had potential but were stagnant throughout.  No one learned from their mistakes, no one improved.  Do I think that will happen with 12 episodes to go?  No, but if it does it will be totally unconvincing and rushed.  The acting, especially of Jin Ye Sol, was positively dreadful.  She seems to have two expressions, neither pleasant, and I was tired of her scowl a long time ago.  She's written as the most two-dimensional, stupid villain ever.  And as near as I can tell, there was no real development in the male lead.  He and Shim Yi Yeong did not seem to have any believable chemistry at all.  He didn't come across a a competent corporate type and seemed  under developed throughout - not sure whether bad writing or mediocre acting was the reason, maybe both.Poor writing paired with mediocre to bad acting earns this a spot on your ""Don't bother"" list."

It was perfect for the mood I'm in which is simple and cute but was a nice change from the usual high school web dramas, less cute & more sensual.It was like a combination of Romance is a Bonus Book & Misaeng squished into 1 hour and 15mins. The best of both worlds. It could have had more of a plot, because the link I clicked was all in Korean I spent 20mins wondering if I missed the first episode, but then it flashed back. The plot's not explicitly set out but it's easy to fill in the gaps. I prefer how rather than bothering wasting time explaining the plot they instead used the time to make it interesting and different (Misaeng-like).I loved the main 2 characters the most, they were not 2D characters at all and (partly due to time constraints I'm sure) that's what I usually expect out of web dramas, even movies. They had so much realistic depth squeezed into 1 hour. The time jumps weren't specified but you can feel the differences in how they act between who they were with, their environment and what's their relationship. I was impressed. Nothing felt too rushed or too slow. I'm also loving how they switched it up and made the male boss the quiet and reserved one while the female lead was playing this quiet junior at work but shows glimpses of being the dominating one in their childhood friendship.I really like the main actor, his voice has such a nice tone. He really reminds me of Kim Young-dae crossed with Baekhyun (EXO)/Minhyuk (BtoB).

I originally planned to watch all 103 episodes in about 2 weeks, but managed to finish in just 5 days.  I must admit that in the beginning, I got really annoyed on how the story is  dragging especially on the mid part, but I've grown to like it until the last episode. This is a ""makjang"" drama. Main plot twists are quite predictable, especially the main character's arc. But what makes a makjang drama effective is not just a great storyline and script, but also having superb and amazing actors to pull off such story. Park Ha Na and Wang Bit Na are truly amazing in this drama. Kyung Hye (Wang Bit Na) is the character I'm attached the most.  Kyung Hye somewhat reminds me of another Wang Bit Na's character Boo Young in the period drama Hwang Ji Ni. Both characters started off as villains, but eventually became the likeable ones towards the end. It is no wonder that both Park Ha Na and Wang Bit Na won awards for playing Se Yeon and Kyung Hye, with Ha Na winning the Best Actress in a Daily Drama award and Bit Na winning the Top Excellence Actress award back in 2018.Can I also say that Kyung Hye and Se Yeon's affection towards each other is lowkey gay? To be honest, Se Yeon and her boyfriend Jae Jun have no chemistry at all, but Se Yeon and Kyung Hye? I ship them like the Titanic. I prayed hard they'd end up together, but the writers decided to make them straight and that's very disappointing. I've read somewhere that the writers might be testing the waters by writing such characters to see if Korean audience is ready and accepting. But man, international audience is thirsty and dying.103 episodes could be too much but hey, it's not bad especially when you're under quarantine. I recommend this drama."

I wouldnt ask for a longer drama because the major plus of this special drama was its snappy pace and the plot rolling along very well from start to end. The plot itself was very engaging, with mystery and thriller nicely packaged and i read everyone enjoyed guessing who the culprit/killer/arsonist is. Made my day when i found out i guessed correctly.
Lee Joon Hyuk is so fitting for the role. He brought this macho and yet boyish vibe to the role. He made Chul Soo a hero but still a human and average guy. Jung In Sung as Jin Ah was good too. They made a striking duo on screen. I wish i can see both of them in a full length drama and if possible paired up again.
Fantastic supporting roles from veteran Lee Won Jong and also Jo Hee Bong and Park Hoon.
Minor qualms that there was some inserted melo drama bits within an action scene that isnt quite believable ina real life and death situation. But overall thoroughly entertained.

Sometimes I feel like its little too slow and the plot is not that exciting. That really down to earth slice-of-life stuff is sometimes a bit too dull, so its always really nice when you do stumble upon one that really works for you. And Navillera is one of those dramas. I just knew from the first episode that this show was going to make me feel good and also make me cry so much, but like in a good way.The tone here is warm, quiet and down to earth and the story itself is not very grand, as it would not fit the story that this drama is trying to say, and yet it truly grabbed me right away. There is a certain softness and wholesomeness that this story just exudes. It radiates warmth and kindness. There was always something so pleasant and comforting about tuning into this show every week and the message of chasing your dreams no matter where you are in life, and its never to late to try is beautiful.Navillera is a really character-driven and character-focus story as we just follow these people throughout their daily-lives and their interactions with each other. Theres really nothing Ive not seen before here. Its a simple setup; Two very different individuals need to work together and somehow they were just what the other one needed. One character is cold and closed-off, the other is not. Youve seen it before so many times, but it works, and the drama never seems boring despite the fact that you sort of know the story thats being told because it has so much heart and tells the story well.Chae Roks relationship with this grandfather that he has been tasked to teaches ballet is so wonderful and pulls at your heart every step of the way. Deok Chool is one of most adorable and wholesome character Ive ever watched. Hes the heart of the show and wow what a big heart it is. Their relationship and Deok Chools determination to chase his dreams is going to make you get misty-eyed every episode of this show.Song Kang and Park In Hwan do such a good job in these roles, although it is the latter who really carries the show on his shoulders, as his character is the heart of the show. They are both so sincere here though and that really shines through. All of the actors on this show do an amazing job to bring these fully fleshed characters to life. I felt like I understood everyone, why they did what they did and their attitude towards life, whether I liked them or not.Often I feel like these types of dramas tend to drag on for a bit or the story isnt big enough for the drama itself, not enough history to be to fill in all the episodes but Navillera uses its time really well and never really drags on. It rather chugs steadily on while focusing on the character and their relationship in a really sincere way. And it certainly helps that Navillera is only 12 episodes, but not the usual 16, like kdramas tend to be.There are certain things that I found predictable within the story, especially as it descends into the latter half and the stakes rise a little bit, but it never got on my nerves and I never found it too bleak. It sometimes filled me up melancholy but because the drama set all of these things up really well these things never came out of nowhere. I was prepared. And there is a certain string of hope that persists within the story despite the lingering sadness that was present within the story. Hope always seems to shine through.The story may be a little standard, a bit after the book at times, but I can not fault the drama because of it because it set everything up very well, it builds up to things, it lays all the groundwork, the character were good, everything that happened seemed earned and not just randomly thrown into the story. It was the story it wanted to be. Plus, the story has a huge heart. So even though I always sort of knew where it was heading. Everything somehow came together really nicely. I got pretty much everything I wanted and expected from this, which was satisfying. Its like a good home-cooked meal that your mom makes. You get what you expected, but its nice."

The leading lady tended to do an annoying pitch to her voice from time to time, and the old ladies were textbook bad guys, so no surprise there either.

That's the plot and my review   In the beginning, I became quickly obsessed with ""Nevertheless,"" even during the torturous wait each week for only one new episode. This series is short so things move pretty fast in the beginning and it's clear that the subject matter is more adult and risqu than usual.  What started out as a realistic look at a messy, addictive, and super toxic relationship turned into a much safer story that I lost interest in. This drama struggles with the idea of exploring non-traditional, and non-idealistic relationships while still wanting to play it safe and not cross too many lines.  This drama had the potential to be cautionary but sadly turned into another love triangle clich.The best thing about this drama is definitely the chemistry between the leads. Han So Hee as the recently heartbroken Na Bi and Song Kang as the manipulative Jae Eon are definitely sexy as a duo. I also admit that Na Bi is annoying at times. Also, even though she is the main lead, she has the least interesting personality of the entire cast, even when listening to her inner monologues. I hated seeing her same wide-eyed expression over and over. Still Na Bi was also super relatable. If you have ever been in a toxic relationship with a narcissist you can probably understand Na Bi and her struggle between doing what she knows she should vs what she can't help but desire. Song Kan is perfectly cast as the charming baby-faced bad boy Jae Eon. His confident smirk is enough to make him very believable as the guy everyone wants, and the guy who can get away with doing whatever he wants. He gave me chills because I definitely know some ""Jae Eons"" and had my own struggles with one. If you ever come across one, run away and save yourself. Believe me! lol! Sadly in the later episodes, his character shifts in a way that made no sense and his performance seemed much more fake and forced, and Na Bi barely had a character arc.As for the supporting cast, this drama does a great job of spotlighting other relationships that are just as interesting as the leads. My only issue is that I felt a little cheated when those other relationships weren't as fully explored. It was clear that there was only so far this drama was willing to go with each story, but the performances were still great, and the couples were cute. Of course, I have to mention the all-star of this drama, the infamous ""Potato Boy"". Chae Jong Hyeop as Yang Do Hyuk is the 2nd lead MVP that dreams are made of. He's cute, he has a sweet smile, he's understanding, he can cook! If you love ""shipping"" the underdog Potato Boy will not disappoint. He was exactly the boost the main couple needed before they got too boring and repetitive. I'm also currently watching him in ""The Witch's Diner"" and he definitely has the potential to become a new favorite of mine. I can't wait to see him star in a full 16 episode drama.Would I watch this again? I'm torn. I think there are definitely some scenes I could rewatch in the early episodes but the payoff was so disappointing that I probably wouldn't. I liked the characters but not enough to want to revisit them. So much about this drama is about awkwardness so it's not exactly a fun rewatch either.  I also had zero interest in the art scenes besides the 2 art pieces that bookend the story. Since Art is what connects all of these characters, that's not a good thing. At least they didn't stretch the story out to make it longer. I maybe even could have been shorter.Overall this drama should have been much better but playing it too safe was its downfall. I know many romance dramas promote unrealistic scenarios, and I don't want to give away anything, but I feel guilty recommending this drama because it may give people too much false hope in a way that could be damaging. Maybe I am too personally biased about the situation, but it still felt a little irresponsible by the end, and It seems the ending is different than the webtoon version (which I am excited to check out).  I thought I might love this drama, but instead, those feelings didn't even last for the full 10 episodes. Nevertheless, I have no regrets and I'm glad I watched it."

This time, it takes up the love and friendship of college students during the Covid-19 era.And even though the concept is interesting, and the mood of the drama just right, youthful and light, as it was in the previous dramas of the series, the story wasn't as strong. It was predictable and cheesy and the drama got too cringey by trying to be hip and up to date with the social media trends. Also, the romance didn't work due to the decisions of the characters. Everything would have been solved if the characters were honest with their feelings. Alas, there was too much unnecessary drama for no reason.On the other hand, the friendship was enjoyable to watch and the college friends had good chemistry with them. Unfortunately, the side characters' stories were left half baked. The constant getting drunk of the female lead got annoying after a while as well.So, overall, three out of ten."

There were a lot of inconsistent actions and it was really sad that they judged people who think and prefer marriage, serious relationship, monogamy as closed minded.While trying to break stereotypes in the series, I couldn't understand why they set up new stereotypes, that didn't make any sense to me.There were explicit scenes at unnecessary moments, it was annoying that no one cared about anything and many toxic behaviors were called normal.At the end of the series, I think they couldn't connect the subject and gave a very unlinked message to the drama, at least that is what I'm thinking.It didn't add anything to me, it was a complete disappointment."

The storyline is repetitive as if it's trying to emphasize a point. Although, I admit I've been lost after watching it as if I forget everything that I watched as well. (Same as how they forget their missing classmate at the end of every other episode)Okay so the plot is like, a creepy substitute teacher came to the school and tries to tempt students with a power that will allow them to get away from what they fear the most. There's kind of a trial period but as they get greedy for more, they have to sign a contract not fully thinking about possible consequences. It only ends with them being trapped on a mirror full of darkness and being forgotten by everyone. This has been repeating 6x on the drama and the only differences are the students have different fears to get away from thus different solutions/scenarios as well with the same pattern.The casts were really good and the creepy teacher gives off that vibe that you can trust him but his smile is also meaningful enough for you to see that behind those smile is a hidden motive. If there's something I didn't really grasp the character, it was Kim SoHyun. Well, she did great in terms of acting but I didn't get what the drama is trying to achieve using her character. It just confuses me (or maybe I'm just too slow, I'm not sure myself.)I mainly watched this because of Kim SoHyun and if you really like her acting she's still superb in this mini-series although the plot can be a bit disappointing. This isn't a bad drama after all you can watch it in one sitting just like how you watch a movie. There's also a lot of good takeaways like how greed can end badly for you. And how nightmares are there not to harm you but to heal you."

I do see the similarities to real life and this drama, portraying matters of friendship problems, trying to find friends, fitting in and losing oneself trying to find their way throughout College Life. It also deals with romance and how it doesn't always work out for some characters, but does for others. It portrays flings and how romance can ruin some friendships but can blossom into love for others. There's also depictions of how rumors and gossip can effect individuals and can tear friendships apart but also how they overcome these obstacles.

xDalso, she has ruined every crime drama male lead out there, no one will be able to surpass her. *cue My Sassy Girl ost*Lee Sun Woo, our ""male lead"" had the opposite role from our active detective. he was a teacher so of course he couldn't investigate, and in some ways he took the role that is usually thrown at women in crime dramas, he had to stand in the side lines waiting like everyone else.but he was still a great guy. he learned from his mistakes and he genuinely cared for his students and he came out of this a better man.Go Eun Ho was just SUNSHINE! and the glue that stuck this drama together, the ""core"" of this drama.also the detective team were awesome, each member was unique, though I wish they gave them a little more screentime ;(Baek Sang Ho... he was so intriguing... he was such a complex character. he ""saved"" people by exploiting/healing their biggest scar, and then he used them dry.. the ending of this drama and their team was so so sad and heartbreaking, and his laughs were chilling.usually, without spoiling anything, I hate crime drama endings becasue everyone just dies and the rest simply move on. but this was such a satisfactory well rounded ending I couldn't help but cry for Baek Sang Ho's end..the ost was beautiful and rather than rewatching I hope for a second season, but this was the 1st crime drama I enjoyed in almost 4 or 2 years that I might actually rewatch it again knowing what I know nowrewatching this I had forgotten about some details regarding the incidents, the biggest impactful details for me were the unexpected friendships vs the manipulative relationshipsbut during this rewatch I was more interested in the twisted relationships of the villains, it wasn't really a cult thing, but the greed, the psychopathness and the love of control was the driving forceas a story, usually mystery dramas had that thing, here as ""where is the lost book"", that seems to be the solution to everything, and once they reach it, it becomes a anticlimactic fast wrap up storyfor this, they had a clear, search, found and a real after effect of what that book contained.as a villain, it was actually really sad, especially when he thought ""what if cha youngjin had found me"" while also giving a sad ending of him not only being punished by going back to his worse nightmare but also the satisfaction of him not just dying and actually getting a punishment worthy of his evil deeds.Seo Sang Won was a psychopath, his father was greedy for power and money that he didn't care for the havoc his son made but instead he used it and the kids Seo Sang Won had to increase his region of power.his sister was fully just greedy for the money and Jang Gi Ho tho lost in his father's haze still had the least evil conception of their cultusually the villain team becomes annoying but here the love and suffocating control Baek Sang Ho had on them not only made them want to rebel but it gave the trio their own bonding that outpowered their fear of Baek Sang HoBaek Sang Ho being twisted as a kid, using the murder of cha youngjin's friend as his stepping stone to outpower his dad and break away from his hold while also still becoming twisted enough to enjoy the chase and obsession left in cha youngjin's heart.his final laugh was taunting tho I do wish it was longer to fully showcase the devastation in his downfalloverall I wish they gave a bit more screen time to the villains fears and darkness a bit moreone of the things I loved about cha youngjin wasn't just her kickass, independent, smart leading boss lady persona but also her strength in showing weakness, vulnerability and tears, not as an attempt to make her ""feminine"" but as a way to show her as a human, as apposed to a ""traumatic"" male leadI also adored Lee Sun Woo's position as what would usually be the female lead, but in a way again as to not ""threaten"" his ""masculinity"" but in a way to make him a great caregiver and sweetness that was lacking in ""what a man should be like"""

This would be an interesting project in itself, yet...The plot is emotionally quite complex, the characters are in principle jucily interesting and ambivalent. If a KDrama can't take care of a multi-layered, complex mixture of feelings, then who can? Unfortunately, I have to say that (in my opinion) this project doesn't really work out so well with the casting. Regarding her emotional intensity, Song Hye-kyeo is (as so often) a major factor for watching. As the heroine, here and there her reservedness, sobered by life, is perhaps a bit much. But in places this cracks open. It is this well dosed mixture and subtleness, that makes her role convincing - the experienced fashion designer in her late 30s has turned away from flirtation and rather concentrates on her work, into which she throws herself completely. Being the talented and experienced professional she is, hardly does she ever get upset by anything. ... until her encounter with the young photographer Yoon Jae-gook, that throws her (emotional) life (supposedly) upside down. Her reservedness so far operated as shelter and imprisonment at the same time. Circumstances don't really offer a chance to free herself from the corset of reason, which is protecting her deeply injured heart - never mind let herself fall and trust emotionally. This inner dynamic is not so nice to look at - or rather endure - for the viewers. But I don't think you can blame Song Hye-kyeo, as she handles this inner tension and the ambivalent moments of her complex role very well.On the other hand (unfortunately) I dont buy Jang Ki-yong in his role as a creative, Paris-based, free-spirited, a bit rebellious, footloose, and at the same time successful photographer. For me he behaves way too reserved, well adjusted, well-behaved - a sympathetic, dear, rich, successful boy. So unfortunately, HIS ambivalence doesn't convince me. Perhaps actor Jang Ki-yong lacks the life experience (on the rebellious side)? And since he cant really fill this side with life, I am not convinced by the chemistry between the two leads. It doesn't get to me how the young man in his supposedly fiery manner, would be able to reignite on an EMOTIONAL level the fire of lust for life and joie de vivre (beyond work) that is still blazing somewhere deep down in Ha Yeong-eun... So the key to all further makjang doesn't really fit into the lock. Too bad. Thus the experiment of telling love in reverse didn't really work out that well.The KDrama is not bad because of that (...though admittedly disappointing ...). On the pro side: There are freshening subplots, each with actors in good humour, who have actually won awards for their spirited performances. The setting in the creative industries is kind of charming, too. Finally, the Korean family values are (once again, but successfully as always) playing with fire on the drama front..."

Worst of all, for me, is a virgin unsure of whether she's been raped and yet happily staying around the suspects for years. SERIOUSLY?Then there's the shotgun.... safer than being left behind, a 'secret', yet openly carried and seemingly taken everywhere. Most cast members took a turn at wielding it as though it were a fairground prop, rather than a loaded weapon capable of blowing someone's head off. No one seemed that scared of it though, happily allowing 'friends' their turn.What exactly this drama was trying to say, is totally beyond me.

Personally i found it challenging to understand many of its scenes and terminologies, especially if you're not familiar with the commerce field or accounting. However, those with knowledge in these areas might enjoy it more.The core plot is straightforward, the ML's father figure commits suicide (later revealed to be murder) due to injustice, leading him to set on a path of revenge. Unlike typical action packed revenge dramas, this one is more business driven.The show has its both positive and negative points .What I liked:1. Acting: The performances of all three lead characters and the supporting cast impressed me. Particularly, SML Han Seung Jo and the main antagonist Han Je Kyun delivered standout performances. The seasoned ensemble actors also gave their best.2. Production value: The drama boasted excellent production value and the budget was put to good use. It even gave me vibes reminiscent of tvN/SBS dramas rather than MBC dramas.3. Background: The drama's setting in an accounting firm was a refreshing change, as there are only a few dramas based on this field.4. Twists: Each episode's cleverly implemented plot twists kept me eagerly awaiting the next episode.What I disliked:1. Story/Writing: Although the plot and background were promising, the execution fell short in helping viewers fully comprehend the complexities. Compared to other dramas based on fields like medical, law, bank, police, esport etc this one proved more challenging to follow. It would have been better if the writers had ensured clarity for a broader audience.2. Characterization: While the male lead Jang Ho Woo's character was decent, I couldn't emotionally connect with him. Additionally, the idea of a high school graduate successfully working in such a prestigious accounting firm seemed implausible. His constant stroke of luck when solving problems didn't feel believable. On the other hand, female lead Jin Yeon Ah's character was disappointing and even some minor supporting characters carried more weight in the plot. Jang Jisoo's character felt more like the actual female lead of the show.In conclusion, the show has its own pros and cons, which may influence your enjoyment of it."

Hm. I've thought whether I should continue watching or drop the series... I've also considered more than once whether I want to write something about it... My feelings about this KDrama are ambivalent. However, the why is this? , is why I actually consider it worth mentioning.Sure, there were bumpy details, like the boys' artificial skin tanning when they were young, but I don't want to dwell on those.>> The decisive factor for me, not rooting so much for this show, was and is that I really do NOT care so much for ANYBODY in this story. I understand, yes. There is empathy, yes. But sympathy? I couldn't care less. I've never had that before. I actually didnt care. Neither the love story, nor the incorrigible rival, nor the girl wanting to bring back her father's cinema  this all and more only had limited impact on me. That's why I was tempted to turn my back on the story. Yet, I don't want to deny the actors' ability. I would do them injustice. They did their job fairly well. There are a number of strong moments. But still, maybe they were not the perfect cast? In any case, I would argue that in OASIS the character portraits were simply NOT drawn that well. ...In my view, that's obviously NOT the strength of the script... Then there is the historical context of the series  the rollercoaster ride of the 80's and 90's. In South Korea, they are the neuralgic interface between dictatorship and democracy. But I don't want to dwell on this either.>> What was decisive for me was that the STORY of the KDrama really mattered to me  whatever triggered the dynamics, the twists and turns. Intertwined with it were indeed countless moments that touched me deeply. Starting with the seed that underlies the whole drama: the fatal loyalty of the former slave not only to his deceased master, who had fought for independence, but also to his son, whom he now still serves as a free man. And then also the fruits that came out of this seed. Plus a lot more. The circumstances, the constraints, the social context that shines through in how it shapes (or had shaped) people, all of this really had me .The way these forces of time and history run along in the background as a matter of course and keep stirring up the lives of the protagonists at crucial points, I think the script did THAT quite well. (However, I don't know whether it would have worked that way if I hadn't already known something about the political and social context back then.)Maybe I could summarize: The portrait of how the historical dynamics are intertwined with personal destinies is well done in ""Oasis"". The character portrait of the comparatively stale protagonists, on the other hand, is less so. This discrepancy, resulting in my rather indifferent experience of the main characters on the one hand, and the emotional force with which the story keeps lashing out on the other hand, is a phenomenon that I have never experienced in a KDrama before. (But I don't necessarily assume that this has to be the same for others as it is for me.)Eventually, despite the ambivalence, I watched to the end and was always curious to see what would be next. I can't say I regret watching either. But then I wasnt all that happy in the end - even though I was partially impressed by the showdown, (yet, again, only partially.) ----------------------- Tiny side note: -------------------------------------Re: 80's and 90's:In connection with e.g. the KDramas ""Sandglass"" and ""Giant"" I have already given some of the political coulors of the 1980s and 1990s. Much of this applies to the historical context of ""Oasis"" as well. (you might want to check there.) Here, though, the dubious role of the secret service comes more into focus.Re. Movie theatre:The dictatorship was characterized by censorship. In addition, there was no freedom to travel. Accordingly, the cinema was like a window to the rest of the world, and generally offered a canvas to dream away from one's own misery, at least for a while. That may be more or less true wherever you look on this planet. But in South Korea at that time certainly more than i.e. in Europe. The role of the cinema in ""Oasis"" not only coincidentally represents liberation (struggle - especially of the female protagonist).---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ps.:Because of this KDrama I stumbled over another one - same title, 20 years older: ""Oasis (2003) "" or ""Desert Spring"". I am grateful for this discovery thanks to the name-connection. Actually I liked that older one (despite the specific doing of that time) even more... Nevertheless I consider ""Oasis"" (2023)  having its moments, too..."

The story illustrates the trials and tribulations of a Niemann-Pick disease sufferer and the people around them.

She has zero self-confidence, and because of her extreme shyness, she doesn’t have any close friends. At the restaurant where she works as an assistant, she’s not particularly good at anything, and mostly just gets yelled at a lot.

Sun Woo is a conceited star chef who’s overflowing with confidence in his food and his skills. Bong Sun harbours a secret crush on him, though he doesn't take much notice of her for two reasons: because he’s always surrounded by women and because he’s hung up on an old flame. But then one day, Bong Sun starts acting differently, shedding her mousy personality, and ends up constantly on Sun Woo’s mind.","Im Joo Hwan, Jo Jung Suk, Kang Ki Young, Kim Seul Gi, Kwak Shi Yang, Park Bo Young",tvN,"This is a very strange rom com, but in a good way.  In many ways it's a love triangle between a shy doormat, a rebellious man-crazy ghost, and a very vain chef. It's also a comedy about a team of chefs in a restaurant (Think ""Pasta""). It's also a mystery thriller, which keeps it engaging when the love story starts to follow too closely to the K Drama standard plot. The plot may be a little hard to follow in the beginning, since there are so many characters, but it eventually all comes together. The story also switches from comedy, to romance, to thriller, refusing to stick to one style completely. It's definitely an ambitious plot, but I think Oh My Ghostess succeeds.

The cast is outstanding, and the reason why the complicated story works so well. Park Bo Young is the most impressive in a lot of ways. She switches from timid to bold believably, which is what makes the love triangle work. She has great chemistry with Jo Jung Suk, which is a huge plus, although I was often annoyed by Seon Woo. The scenes when she aggressively propositions him are hilarious, and a nice change from how these romances usually develop. Those scenes are what convinced me to keep watching.

Many of the supporting cast members are as engaging as the main characters. The bromantical team of Chefs, Bing Go the ghost hunter, Sun Ae's father, Seon Woo's mom, Im Joo Hwan's smile... Still, Kim Seul Gi is my favorite of the main cast. I was rooting for her from the beginning, and she is the show's star in my opinion. She made me laugh out loud, and cry buckets, and I looked forward to her scenes the most. 

I had to give this show a high rewatch score, because I am already watching it again. Since I know the story now, there are moments in the beginning that I see differently, and it's making me like the drama even more (Especially the first episode). I became so invested in the characters that I enjoy watching the story again from that perspective. 

Overall this drama was a happy surprise. It had elements of two dramas I love (""Pasta"" and ""Master's Sun"") while still being original enough to stand on it's own. There are definitely predictable moments, and filler comedy moments, lots of coincidences, and some over used K Drama standards towards the end, but I was still never bored. The thriller element wasn't the strongest storyline, but it was still good, and certainly entertaining. I was happy with how it all ended too, which is important when you have so many characters that you suddenly care about. I definitely recommend watching this one with an open mind. You may not be into it in the beginning, but if you're like me, you soon won't be able to stop watching it, as if you're... wait for it... possessed."

The editing was choppy but I suspect that is because of the time frame allotted for the drama.

The pace was off, with some badly edited scenes and a few questionary camera angles. The twists were also old, especially those towards the ending, and they were not entertaining. The focus on the love triangle, also, was a false move. It was itself forced and it messed things up a lot and unnecessarily. The bromance that they tried to enforce was boring as well. Not to mention the side couples that tried too hard to be funny, but failing every time. As for the worst moment of the drama, that would be the ending. The fantasy element was bad right from the start, was never properly explained, was often forgotten, did not fit the main mood of the drama and, in the end, ruined the ending.However, there were some good things that helped a bit. The family drama was good and the mothers' relationships with their children were just so warm and sweet and all the actors and actresses did a great job with them. The performances overall were enjoyable and top-notch but the script did not help them at all. The main couple, in addition, had chemistry and were good together.So, overall, four out of ten.

If he is in a drama, I already have a reason to like the drama... a lot. So ji Sub could do 16 episodes on a toilet, or preferably in a shower, and I will watch every single episode happily. So yes, I really liked this drama, but I am well aware of my bias, since I also had a lot of issues with ""Oh My Venus"". 

I'll start with what I loved about it, besides the obvious, and that's not only the main romance, but also the bromance. I think Shin Min Ah is such a great partner for So ji Sub. Their romance is full of clichs, while avoiding some others, but I was glued to my screen anticipating them getting together. They are a sort of ""super pairing"", and they don't disappoint. They had really great chemistry, a grown up sexy chemistry, even in her fat suit. 

Oh yeah, let's talk about the ""fat"" suit. It's not really a spoiler to say that a transformation is inevitable, but I don't want to give too much away. I will just say that there were moments when I missed seeing her in the fat suit, because I got so used to seeing her character that way. She's very pretty skinny or chubby, and they did a really good job making her chubbier face look very realistic. I also appreciated that the transformation wasn't insultingly instant, and that it was for health, and not just looks. I was worried that the plot would be much more superficial than it was, especially considering S Korea's extreme beauty standards. This romance is less about wooing a guy with a makeover, and more about how opposites can attract.

So ji Sub's bromance with Sung Hoon and Henry Lau was another reason I became addicted to this drama. Kang Joo Eun is in an enviable position, getting to be around the three of them so much. The dynamic between the four of them was extremely fun to watch. I'll add the assistant/manager to the bromance, because he was great too! Of course Henry is extra cute all by himself, and surely a stand out favorite for most fans of the show. 

What I really disliked was the supporting leads. Woo Sik isn't meant to be a likable character, but I guess Jung Gyu Woon played the part so well that I couldn't stand him at all (and he's played characters I despised before). I had zero empathy for Woo Sik, or his poor fashion choices. Then there's the equally unlikable Soo Jin. Even with her backstory, I still could not make myself like her even a little bit. Yoo In Young is also not the greatest actress. Although she played bitter very well, the rest of her performance fell flat. Way too much time was spent on their relationship. Plus, I thought them being together at all made absolutely no sense, which made their scenes hard to sit through patiently. Their story had more drama than the main couple at certain points, but I honestly just wanted to skip through their scenes.

I gave ""story"" a really low score because the plot just seemed too all over the place. The John Kim story was such a big deal at first, but then soon fizzled. Kim Yeong Ho's family issues were so hard to follow, and I still don't get why they were so dysfunctional. Hyun Woo's divorce was mentioned so many times, and it had no real use in the plot (maybe it's a bigger stigma that I realize? If not, it made no sense to keep bringing it up). Then there were matters of life and death that kept happening seemingly to fill the time. 

Even the main love story fell prey to the curse of Kdrama Rom coms. That's when a drama is much longer than it should be, so they just throw in a bunch of random cute scenes with the main couple, and hope their chemistry will keep you watching. I waited eagerly for the last 2 episodes, but was mostly bored watching them. There was even an overload of flashbacks, and some obligatory product placement, to help them reach the 16 episode finish line. The romance does end in a pretty cute way, but the extra scene at the end was super unnecessary in my opinion, and proof to me that the writers were kinda winging it. Still, It wasn't all bad, because I totally loved the scarf!

The music was cute, and fit the show well. A couple of the songs grew on me after hearing them on loop, and I still hear them in my head while I type this. o.O

Overall, this drama owes it's success to it's cast (well, most of the cast). It's weird that although I will miss seeing episodes, I would have liked it much more if it was shorter, and it left on a high note. Personally, I'd only watch certain scenes again, or maybe I'd just skip forward through every scene that isn't about the bromance or the main romance. A re-edited version would have gotten much higher marks from me! Do I recommend this show? Of course. So Ji Sub + Shin Min Ah  >  Bad Writing (#math), and what the writers get right is that they play up the chemistry to the maximum, which is more than enough for most viewers."

With the variety of unique characters, its a story relatable even for people who never worked in a similar environment. It tackles issues like retirement, layoffs, job hunting, reassignments in the workplace, power struggle, but also more universal topics like acting in line with your principles, loyalty, friendship, selfishness vs selflessness. The three main characters present different takes on life and dealing with problems. Dang Ja Yeong tries to go by the book, following instructions, seeing it as the best and most efficient way. Choi Ban Seok is a hardworking and loyal person, who is willing to risk his career if faced with moral dilemmas. There are many nasty ways to describe Han Se Kwon, and Im truly forcing myself to stay civil here. Lets say he represents the inferiority complex in the perfect way, spiced with his cunning and shady behavior. As the drama progresses, we see how they manage to face all the problems happening in Hanmyung Electronics and what are the results of their actions. There is no plot that goes from point A to point B, as the drama focuses more on the relationships between the characters, different departments, higher-ups and the employees. The comedy, though, how good it was! There is nothing better than situational comedy based on the characters personalities and relationships. No cheap jokes that could work in any scenario. The casting was a pure perfection. Each of the actors fitted their roles perfectly. Big props to Kim Nam Hee for his job on Shin Han Soos character, who became one of my favorites. The production value is insanely good. I have truly nothing to complain about. The soundtrack has plenty of amazing songs from slow ballads to indie pop and rock. Realistically speaking, this show might not have the same entertainment value for people preferring fast paced, plot driven dramas. There are many questionable choices made by all the characters, so if you look for a clear cut smart at any occasion or good at any occasion, you will not find it here. Characters excel in some areas, but fail on others - for me, thats the charm and the realism of the show.

This wasn't a lust drama but one of mutual respect for the person that is the object of affection.  One of the most satisfying endings for a K drama that usually spoils the ending withe the contrite attempts to redeem characters so everyone has a feel good experience.   In real life and in this drama responsibility is the main theme.  Responsibility to marriage, children and to self are all analyzed in unique ways.  Tolerance and intolerance are so explored.

All things considered Once Again is possibly the best family kdrama ever produced. The content that was meant for different audiences is bearable. The makjang stays just below my nerve threshold. I'm sure you all know how the typical kdrama recipe is like, where everything goes to shit around episode 14-15 and then we get a happy ending in the last episode. Despite the 50 episodes the ratio of conflict is very similar to a regular kdrama, but while binge watching this the ""bad"" episodes can be a bit taxing since there are 3 times as many of them due to the overall length of the show. Overall I'm happy that I watched Once Again, but I ended up skipping many of the annoyances. edit: My Father is Strange is a very comparable family drama."

Unfortunately though it does step in and manage to kill the mood ah I really should get over it, but its done sooo clumsily here.Look theres nothing original, everything is bland, innocuous and inoffensive (and that includes the chemistry, or lack of it) but the short half-hour format makes it an ideal watch for those times when youve come home exhausted and all you want to do is curl up in front of the fire and veg out with something totally predictable, brainless, sweet and cosy.What my rating means: 7+ A watchable drama, but nothing exceptional.

The next stage just comes...  Then comes another stage, followed by more stages to go. I dont think I have ever watched a show that introduces so many interesting topics to think about in such a light and heartwarming manner. The episodes might have been only 24 minutes long, but the impact lasted for hours, making me reflect on my opinions, thoughts and behaviors. From the opening till the end - it felt both realistic and strangely eccentric and dream-like. Following Ha Jyung on the trips allowed me to take a moment to just relax and enjoy the views and the scenery. The straightforward and honest personality of our female lead added to the charm. I also appreciated how real her character was - a normal person in normal circumstances, taking a break from the busy and overstimulated world.The wide range of topics tackled in the show included, but was not limited to: reflecting on our past goals and dreams, the role of an educator, adults' involvement in creating certain paths for children, focusing on their future rather than the current happiness, the disagreements and different perceptions generations have, where we always villainize the other side, not seeing the flaws in our own thinking and behavior. We were faced with questions like: is striving for success correct, or should we  just focus on doing what we love, even if it does not bear fruits? Why is it so hard to show interest towards another person and since when saying I love you or even I like you becomes so hard, that we found new ways to convey exactly the same emotions? This is not all, and Im sure each and every person would focus on different aspects, different scenes and different lines - seeing their own unique version of whats presented in the drama.Lee Na Young was such a perfect casting choice to portrayal Ha Kyung. On one hand her character was truly relatable, on the other hand she had her own charms and quirks that not many people possess. Creating a character that is both unique, but also relatable is not an easy job. The production was stellar. All episodes were filmed, directed and edited in a similar fashion, but at the same time, all had specific tricks that enhanced whatever story was told in each episode. Be it adding more blur and slightly distorted shots to create these dream-like sequences, or using first person perspective to make viewers connect to the scene and potential feelings the characters are experiencing. The soundtrack was the cherry on top, making me want to drop whatever I was doing and set on a trip myself. Overall, I feel like no matter how much time I would spend on writing this review, it would be impossible for me to truly convey how much I love One Day Off. It's a rare clean 10 for me."

It got pretty angsty in the middle part, but it seemed to keep coming back around to funny and cute before it got too sad. I think I would have liked to have seen it extended by 1 episode because I wasn't totally satisfied by the ending (needed some epilogue moments!) I also enjoyed the cameo by Conan O'Brien - talk about unexpected! I did enjoy the side stories of Mi Mo's friends and I did like Mi Mo's romance, but I felt that the story could have been handled better and there should have been more funny and cute moments than we actually got. Oddly enough, I most liked the story between Da Jeong and her husband. Even though it was the ""quietest"" story, it was the most moving. Poor Dong Mi's romance was the saddest, and Ae Ran's was the most unique (those 2 had an interesting relationship) Each relationship is very different, and so the telling of each brings something different to the story.

From first impressions, this drama may seem like a very light-hearted love story between 2 youths. However, as each episode unfolds, you realize how much depth this story surprisingly has. The story itself has does have some repetitions - at first, it seemed like bad editing, but as you continue, you will soon realize more and more, that the story was made this way on purpose to send the right message. I was very surprised of how a simple on-the-surface plot can be transformed into a feels-train with its hidden complexity. Needless to say, this is a must-watch imo

CHARACTERS / ACTING
This drama really only focuses on one character - Yoo Tak, which at first seemed like a generic character.. and he actually is. As someone who enjoys music, Yoo Tak is very relatable and you will see how he makes mistakes not just for the sake of drama. Among L's work, this is definitely one of the better roles he does done. The lead actress also did very well on her character.

MUSIC
The music in this mini-series is absolutely mesmerizing! There are a few scenes in this drama where nothing is actually presented visually - but the music coupled the situation so well that it was actually driving the story and gave it life and meaning. Particularly, there's a light guitar track with some vocals that really enhanced the experience."

I'm not a true crime fan or whatever but I've always heard this, when they interview neighbors and witnesses of a serial killer they always say ""he was quiet"", ""he was a good student"", ""he was clean cut and handsome and soft spoken"", ""I could never imagine he had 100 bodies in his basement""and that's why the cop is so focused on KHS. he looks nonthreatening, he looks pitiful and vulnerable and that's triggering for him.the prosecutor just wants to win a big case and that lawyer lady just wants to be known as the person who had that casebasically everyone was projecting their own greeds on KHS and that's why his situation is heartbreakingSPOILERSbut if I may be the critic I am, I didn't like eps 5 and 6 because they added nothing to the drama, it was just repetition. I also didn't like who the killer was... they questioned EVERYONE, beside the drug dealer... the guy that was beneficial in the 1st trails verdict reduction? they never mentioned it again.. she gave him the drugs.. tbh I don't know law but if he had killed under the influence of drugs she gave him then as they 1st said, he didn't ""do it on purpose""it's like 14 days.. after the whole ""whodunit"" they go and say the killer was severely druggedanyway... the way they caught the killer after the trails, the way the last ep played out, the scene of him on the roof (even though I get the heartache of him becoming so detached) was too long, and then they bring another similar case.. atleast he has more experience this timebut overall, I wanted to see what will happen to KHS.. would he recover, go to law school and defend the falsely blamed, or would he get eaten by the darkness and drugs..also my poor Ji Taeand bone breaker ;("

The chemistry between the two leads is amazing, and they're both fantastic even on their own.  It's a relatively gentle pace throughout and just such a good story I was always looking forward to seeing them face their next challenge.   There's lots of similarities you could draw between this and Something in the Rain - it's got a lot of the same cast even, same ML but different FL and other parental roles moved around a bit.  Having literally watched Something in the Rain just before this it was a little surreal with husband and wife from one now in separate families in the other but... that's ok :)Where Something in the Rain tried and failed, One Spring Night tries and scores a home run.He is ""flawed"", he is a single dad of a son.  She's got a boyfriend at the start and are starting to talk about Marriage, but she's not on the same page and frustrated with the relationship.  This sets up the tone for a story with lots of factors working against the couple, whether it's the notion that she might be considered to have ""cheated"" on her boyfriend, or whether others will accept that she wants to get involved with a single dad and all the ""baggage"" that brings.  Parents on both sides bring challenges but they're different, the ML's parents are over protective about things that might bring him the kind of sadness that left him a single dad and the FL's parents are traditional and ""difficult"".I was absolutely delighted with the FL's mother in this, you can see her growing and evolving around the changing situation around her and reacting in a really great and supportive way - even if it takes her a bit to get there.  The same actress played the absolutely nasty mother in Something in the Rain so this was a redemption from my perspective, as odd as that might sound :)Initially I was confused about why the FL wasn't being more direct about breaking up with her boyfriend, and I must confess that I'm married to my first love (24 years now) so... i'm totally inexperienced in this kind of thing... but as the story progressed I grew to appreciate that it hadn't been a binary switch-off, it made the time that things properly change that much more valuable when it happened, and also meant that her previous relationship wasn't trivialised and thereby her attitude to relationships in general wasn't. It did also somewhat talk to one of my other general meanderings - if someone cheats, betrays a partner, and goes to someone else... surely the new partner must always have in the back of their mind - that person has already demonstrated that they have the capacity to change, to betray and to move on, what worked in their favour today could happen again but against them.  The ML's insecurities about this surface at an important point and it creates some tension but I thought it was dealt with well.There are other arcs in this as well, I think that the general arc that follows her and her sisters around and the things happening to them is probably just as important as the main love story.  I struggle to find flaw with this, I was just so happy watching it all the way through, other than towards then end when I realised I was going to run out of show and this amazing couple were no longer going to be in my life, but, i'll probably get over that when I start my next drama :-PHighly recommended, and as the flow is not really ruined by knowing what happens, it makes it all the more easy to re-watch again if you want 16 episodes of lovely warmth to keep you company on a cold weekend."

The first season felt too rushed, and, as I was ignorant to the fact that the drama was divided into three seasons, I was surprised that the story was concluded in episode 3! An other thing that didn't work for me, was the band concept. I thought it was childish and too unrealistic, not that they weren't talented, but to get to be idols?? In addition, the performances were so so. The female lead wasn't good, especially in the first season, but got a little better towards the end. The second male lead was surprisingly good, and I liked his story and his whole appearance of this bad boy vampire. The male lead was good as well, but that was expected. The costumes were really nice, and, surprisingly, the special effects were realistic enough. So, 3.5 out of 10."

Also, school life, friendship and first love are always the main themes of webdramas where you can't really go wrong with them. The performances were good, in addition, from every actor and actress of the cast. Especially the leading lady, she was adorable and easily likable. However, the webdrama was either too short, or the script didn't help with the presentation of the story. The characters felt flat and one dimensional. An example that comes in mind is the female lead, who said that she wanted to be special, even though she never explained what was the root of her ambition. The drama swept off many of the issues that could easily have added some depth to the story, and ended up with a half baked romance.So, overall, four out of ten."

The story is complicated, but not nearly as complicated as many other historical dramas, and while some twists are more predictable than others I did enjoy the level of suspense as well as how the story tied together. The main villain of this story is the perfect villain, so greedy, smart and evil that there is no way i hell anyone would ever wish for anything other then a slow and painful death to this person, however that person is not the only villain in this story, and that is what I love about this that even if we get some  pure greed and evil we also get the ""It's complicated""  side to this plot. Park Hyung Sik is the perfect prince, vulnerable, smart (a bit like his character in Suits but with power and fame), he thinks beyond himself and even acknowledges that women are not object, odd but true (which kind of makes this not so realistic after all),  His acting is spot on, his charm is all over the place and yes I may be bias but I had been looking forward to seeing him in this and was not disappointed.  Jeon So Nee (the female lead) got a really lovely character to portray (most of the time), smart, funny, forward, had great lines and though there where some inconsistencies  with her character (she could be impulsive and stupid at times) I truly loved her character. However acting wise I think Pyo Ye Jin (the female leads maid) as well as the princess  (Jung Da Eun)  did a more convincing job. Overall I would say the female characters in this drama may not have been very realistic but I fell for them all. There where some annoying overacting parts in this but they did not take over or diverge from the main  plot of conspirecys, greed and equality.  As the crossdressing is used in an appropriate well written way. As a girl no one will tell you ""try it, you can do it, go ahead... + Hiding... As no one could ever guess these very feminine looking people dressed as women are actually men... (yes I am being sarcastic) The romance is  beautifully subtle yet slow and by slow I mean painfully slow (for obvious reasons), so for the romance lover out there you are going to have to be patient, really, really patient and you may just may have to settle for the subtle hints of romance you get or  I assume you will find yourselves kind of frustrated.  I really enjoyed this and would definitely recommend this  to those who want to watch an historical that is kind of light without being a  ridiculous mishmash pop culture historical. If you want something more heavy I would recommend you watch something else like Under The Queens Umbrella or maybe The Red Sleeve..."

This is a drama that deals with a whole bunch of relationships, a true exploration of relations, regret, sorrow, pain... anger and so on. As they gather some of South Koreas greatest actors and actresses to deliver characters and stories far beyond how we are used to seeing them.The first 3 episodes where kind of meh though they lay some of the ground work to understanding the characters they may put people off this show which would be a shame. As episode 4 was really good, 5 great and then it goes a bit back and fourth with how good, powerful and interesting the episodes/stories are. While some of the episodes could easily score a 6 , others 10 and well more or less anything in-between. However  the way this is intwined and the way things progress, the way the writer keeps us on our toes at times, as well as those really good stories ultimately made me give this a 9. The acting was spot on, the OST may not always have suited my personal taste but it was well fitted with the story and cinematography all there to make people feel things. Well balanced, well made and yes they did make me cry once or twice towards the end. What I liked most about this drama was how the characters are shown as real human  beings, while some indeed needed to be sent to anger management and got on my nerves more than once none of the characters or relationships where made flat, no one was just whatever typecast one would think they could be. No matter gender, age, disability, and hardships the people in this village meet they are shown to be more than just that story. This is done with the use of  flashbacks, scenes where they meet  prejudice, monologues... We get to see their hopes, struggles, solutions, and what not all shown all in a lovely mix. At times giving the viewers the blues, other times giving us hope... Some times plain pissing us off. While I am a sucker for romance the romance in this drama is definitely secondary, do not get me wrong the romance here is lovely and gives us a break from the heavy and painful life parts. But the stars of this show are the friendships, family ties and relationships over generations. There are a few stories I would have wanted to see less of, other stories that left me wanting more. There where several parts of this show that did not sit right with me at all and had me questioning the writers motives. However The fact that this writer makes place for all these different stories wins over the bad. This is not a romcom, or a feel good drama, the few comic relief parts felt pretty unnecessary. So if you are looking for inspiration or feel good this is definitely not it.  But if you want some good cinematography, human nature,  painful and honest dialog this is a pretty decent place to find it.

The drama had an overwhelming number of cast members and an overwhelming number of small scattered stories, even though  this is a long format drama but it back fired. The lead couple are the weakest point for the drama. Them as actors, their story, their development, their resolution and the attention they were given all of which was borderline bad and they're suppose to be the ""leads"".  This lead couple had a total, as I counted, 14 breakups/fights, my god I just wanted them to break up for good or die I don't care anymore fuck them! No wonder ""Lee Ha Na"" dropped out from being the female lead after the first script reading session.  Speaking of which, the male lead Heo Gap Dol is the most pathetic loser I've ever seen, he remained a loser even at the end. Let's talk about Heo Da Hye, the male lead's sister, she's one of the most interesting characters in the drama yet the creators completely destroyed her. From the end of episode 33 she was completely cut off abruptly from the drama with absolutely zero mention of her as if she never existed. Her mother, brother, kids, ex-husband all carried on as if she never existed. It seems like the character Ban Ji A became her replacement just for Soo Jo's sake.The beginning of episode 34 marked a clear big shift in the writing and direction. The writer didn't no where or how to steer the ship from there, it took a random turn every now and then, some characters started to disappear for 4-5 episodes at times (including leads), the leads were treated like guest characters with minimum updates or attention, most cute moments became cheesy and cringe, half of the supporting cast rarely appeared afterwards, the whole story became too scattered and the stretch of events got too obvious as they were trying to prolong the series. One thing really bothered me is how the drama took a weird detour that included manipulating emotions in solving every single problem/relationship, rather than fixing them in a healthy way.Can't recommend."

(A hybrid?)  Ok, this series tells a Korean story, its about Korean destinies. BUT it's not an original KDrama. It is a (western) Apple production in which some (Apple) producers from the US obviously had a say. So, first of all, a bit of criticism about the American serial adaptation of a bestseller novel, which 'coincidentally' has a Korean fate as its subject. (Before I go into praise...)North Americans with Korean family backgrounds may have been involved in the production (the directors, the person responsible for the script adaptation and a lot of actors, for example). Nevertheless, it is and remains a North American production. The sad thing about it: the series production repeats - if you like - the theme of the story in a new media version: in this case, the profitable exploitation of 'Korean stories', 'Korean fates' and even a bit of the KDrama soul...Using the example of several generations of a Korean family and their personal destinies against the background of Japanese colonization and racism to this day, why reduce a 500-page book to ONLY 8 episodes? Why not use the time and space and retell the story in at least 20 episodes, or even 50? Quite simply: the series production is not of South Korean origin, and it is not made for South Korean television, but for the international streaming market. The rest of the world isn't THAT interested in South Korea, but it is quite touched by Korean fates. So, the enthusiasm for the original bestseller in a binge-capable, compact format has to be cleverly marketed in a colorful and moving way in order to attract new streaming subscribers to Apple. The world (those who have not yet read the book but have now watched the series) is shocked and touched by what happened between Japan and South Korea, which is still today formative for many Koreans. The rest of the world was hardly aware of this historical chapter. However, in the series adaptation, the individual fates were told less in detail. They were rather reduced to catchy basic emotions, and these were cleverly knotted as a cross-generational leitmotif in key scenes over time jumps. The focus is on Sunja - with the focus on Sunja in her third phase of life. This is embodied by Youn Yuh-jung, who was already able to leave a lasting impression on the international audience with (her Oscar for) ""Minari"" and thus gets plenty of screen time as a 'star' among many internationally comparatively unknown actors.Well, that's the way it is.If you have a background with KDrama, you will find a nice study object in ""Pachinko"" to compare the different narrative styles (Western style vs. Korean style) with regard to emotionality. Western style would be more like: 'I WATCH the mimes have their feelings'. The individual sequences of different timelines, some of which are strung together at very short intervals, convey this 'Western' handwriting. This is, so to speak, Western objectivity in the depiction of emotionality. The (South) Korean narrative style, on the other hand, deliberately draws the audience into the emotional world. E.g. 'I sympathize. I'm IN there too.'So, with ""Pachinko"" there was a lot of Korean heart and soul mixed into the story and series adaptation. You can feel that. This is how an interesting hybrid production actually came about. It's not a KDrama, but a Korean story with a lot of Korean heart. Thus, the spirit of Korean storytelling still blows through some of the scenes. Actually, even the concept chosen for the series adaptation is the strongest element: if such a complex family saga is told in 8 episodes, then through the characteristic basic emotions in the form of impressive scenes - less in plot, action and dialogues. For example: when the mother ceremonially prepares the rice for the wedding, which they are actually not allowed to eat, or the young bank employee throws his expensive jacket into the puddle and dances footloose to the street music on the open street (in Japan!), or the grandmother, completely moved, after decades back on South Korean soil on the beach of her childhood... There are strong scenes like this - lastingly impressive, without words - that (want to and actually do) touch the heart. THAT, I would think, is Korean style in the way of its storytelling. It somehow sneaked into the production (still US production, even if it was trilingual) and confidently took its place. (Perhaps in the same way that people under Japanese oppression quietly preserved their inner dignity and inner defiance despite all bending and suffering.)And by the way: the title track may be well and good. But! The intro clip is in my eyes most peculiar and completely missing the subject. It's nice that all generations come together here, but the extreme exuberance of the dance performance has nothing to do with the rest of the series. It seems rather strange, how in contrast to the particular, muted, rather gloomy 'Han' (Korean pain/world pain) of the story it comes along in such outlandish US style...Nevertheless: the series is captivating, moving and over all a rather inhospitable excursion into inhospitable Korean living conditions, which are emotionally shaped for some even to this day by the Japanese colonial era. Even decades later in Japan and the USA, life is shown rather inhospitable. Only a few well-chosen scenes open up in a visually stunning and atmospheric way, as if to remind us that life itself is a gift...Even if it's only told in 8 episodes (and by now apparently in 8 more for a second season), ""Pachinko"" offers an unforgettable, visually stunning excursion into a sad segment of recent Korean history using the example of a moving family saga. A concentrated load of multifaceted contemporary rich topics that can at best be roughly touched or tabbed upon in the series adaptation. Nevertheless. It is definitely a masterpiece to compress the 500-page epic into 8 slim episodes and - without having to bend the story too much - to convey a stringent, central emotional attitude even in the face of the inhospitable nature of being: the protagonist despite all the suppression keeping a quiet, inner dignity, grounded and clear - from there drawing the strength to face life and its challenges again and again, in all simplicity.Lastingly impressive!"

Fine personality portraits, none of them smooth and pore-deep clean, but rather inwardly crumpled people with dreams and weaknesses, people who sometimes make questionable decisions, who don't stick to the rules, who succumb to the temptation to take the chance to realize their dreams.A little 'noir' here and there. In any case, emotionally dense. Unexcitedly emotional. Quiet and yet powerful. The KDrama is based on a Japanese Original (Mitsuyo Kakuta), which was successful as a series and movie, too. This is now a South Korean remake. Apparently, Kim Seo-hyung was immediately (after she saw the original in 2015) determined to play the female lead in any potential South Korean remake right. You can tell, she is breathing her role.The original novel is about the embezzlement of bank funds as actually happened in Japan. In South Korea, the list of embezzlement in billions is also long and the remake is accordingly well placed.However, the South Korean remake is about more than misappropriation of wealth on a large scale. This is generally about lies, deceit and deception - even on a smaller, manageable, interpersonal level. However, it is also about human vulnerability, the breaks in the facade.The story unfolds against the background of unstoppable consumption - a veritable frenzy of consumption that has long since left any connection or grounding behind. A life-style in a parallel world, that only a few can really afford. This world of luxury, which initially seems appealing, develops an intoxicating, addictive character and ultimately catapults itself into the void. What remains when the lover equips the lover with the designer goods from head to toe, from the car to the house including the interior and the laptop, too? Alert, alert: the luxurious world of matter - initially well camouflaged as the lifestyle of your dreams - becomes an ugly parasite that feeds on substantial emotions, liveliness and passion, but in the end leaves nothing behind...In the field of tension between the dreary normality of a boring everyday life that is perhaps pimped out on the outside, but rather emotionally rather empty, almost everyone here is willing to deviate from the path of virtue in order to get a piece of the promisingly dazzling consumer cake.Nevertheless, the story also tells of the sincere moments of perception and recognition of unsightly vulnerability. These are the moments when sincere encounter happens to become possible. On the outside, these are not the nice, shiny TaDa moments, but on the inside they provide light and warmth, they nourish the soul, like water making flowers bloom. Moments that cannot be bought with money. Moments that are among the most worthless in the dazzling world of consumption, shunned, despised, marginalized, excluded.In this way, ""Paper Moon"" is an intelligent approach of reckoning with the consumer-driven social reality in which 'appearance' takes the place of 'being'. Quietly and constantly the KDrama is reminiscent of the basic in human, which has nothing to do with staged perfection, but rather with irrational impulses and irreconcilable paradox. At most, beauty in being human unfolds when weaknesses become strengths, when ruptures make the whole, when betrayal opens the door to freedom, when loss becomes the gate to abundance, when I find myself by losing myself, etc.Since we are all human, we can remember (that we are like that too) and empathize and accept ourselves (and others!) even in our (their) 'ugliness', 'despair' and 'failure'. That makes life truly valuable and remains as a valuable experience, even if any material value has long since disappeared.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SIDE NOTE: --------  'Paper Moon' vs. 'Pale Moon' ----------The original title ""Paper Moon"" was for the international title particularly changed from ""Paper Moon"" to ""Pale Moon"" in order to create a certain degree of selectivity from the Japanese original. The story may be remade, but it's retold in characteristic korean-style. Successfully so. And if you like, the changed nuance in the title already testifies to a finely nuanced, additional facet within the KDrama production.The term ""PAPER MOON"" refers to a fake, oversized crescent made of cardboard, which became fashionable at the time, with the advent of photography, as a specific variant of (cheap but effective) portrait background. At fairs, etc., photographers as a special gag offered the cheerful visitors unforgettable portrait photography in front of an artificial crescent moon made of cardboard. The happy couples (but also everyone else who had their picture taken) floated optically above the clouds, removed from everyday life, yet oh so close to the (artificially fake) sky... A reMINDer, documenting a very special moment. Since then, the meaning of the paper moon generally refers to an object with the help of which a void is filled with fictitious, purely optically reality  a make believe. However, the emptiness is still there. The symbol, enriched with meaning, inspired many a great work. One of them is the piece of music ""It's only a Paper Moon"" (originally ""If you believed in me""), which summarizes the basic idea or the basic feeling in a striking way - as a tightrope walk between hope and hopelessness...""Say, it's only a paper moon Sailing over a cardboard sea But it wouldn't be make-believe If you believed in meYes, it's only a canvas sky Hanging over a muslin tree But it wouldn't be make-believe If you believed in meWithout your love It's a honky tonk parade Without your love It's a melody played in a penny arcadeIt's a Barnum and Bailey world (=circus attraction) Just as phony as it can be But it wouldn't be make-believe If you believe in me""...The unreal reality, the deception, the lie, all of this could be true if only one can convince the others that it is so.""PALE MOON"" on the other hand refers more to the real, pale (full) moon in the night sky, which is repeatedly staged in this KDrama. It's not dazzling like the radiant, all-illuminating, blinding sun, and not loud and spectacular like fireworks, (and not as big and dominant next to me as a paper crescent moon). The pale (full) moon only shimmers in the dark hours of the day. It may light the way and also cast shadows, yet from my perspective it is just tiny and far away. Nevertheless, despite appearing almost fragile and delicate, is solidly stands there like a vague, quiet, soothing reminder of something truly beautiful and valuable. Something that is there repeatedly, with beautiful regularity - remaining, just being, no matter what. Something to relate to. Far way it may be, yet emotionally quite substantial - and thus close to the HEART."

My only regret about this drama is that they tried too many things at such a short time. They wanted to present the struggles of an upcoming idol group that were consisted by misfeats who had trouble becoming an idol individually. The concept was nice at first, but then they tried to add romance into it, with no proper time to develop the love story properly, drama with power struggles and rich people aiming to stop the group from debuting, sad background stories, friendship dynamics being tested and such.

This is the Korean version of CSI/NCIS and it has all the same weaknesses as the originals. Instead of the more usual focus on the machinations of internal politics, the slow unfolding of a crime, the in-depth character interactions (imo the strengths of Korean crime dramas), we have a series of crimes dealt with in one or two episodes and some two dimensional characters whose personalities have been clearly modelled on the American versions. Everything skims along the surface, with no depth and no character deviation or development. Crimes are solved in superficial and ridiculous ways in double quick-time and theres a load of spurious criminal psychology. The convenient plot devices stack up and all credibility is trampled. The young female prosecutor seems to have inordinate amounts of time to hang around watching autopsies and never has to do anything boring like sit at her desk and work. She has a penchant for doing stupid things that get her into life-threatening situations from which she always miraculously escapes. Horrendous experiences abound with zero effect on characters who bounce back to what they were in as much time as it takes to run to the next scene. And just to increase the air of unreality, the director requires the actors to really ham it upIf you like the style of CSI then youll probably like this. Personally I think its a really bad imitation of a bad American original.What my rating means: 1 - 3+ Totally unbearable, but often compulsively watchable as you really cant believe that it can be this bad."

""Payback: Money and Power"", again, is one of those. It offers an exciting, astute, complex and clever story about revenge against those giants, who can hardly ever successfully be confronted by legal means. Money helps those... who want to have things turn out the way that they prefer who can afford to have things turn out the way that they prefer... who have a strong vision, too.The underlying premises are pretty sobering, yet well-known territory in KDrama land:-The system (democracy and the rule of law) serves the money, not the people, because the people who fill the system with life can be bought.-Power and money are inseparable.-Hierarchical class thinking is far from overcome. The value of a person's wealth directly determines their value as a human being.-Huge fortunes and legality rarely go hand in hand.-The good news for the wealthy: money can buy you justice (and law).-The bad news for the ordinary: Life is unfair.-With legal means (alone) justice is not a given.""Payback: Money and Power"" bluntly takes all of these premises and blends them in a vendetta against Goliath revisited. Therefore, David first becomes a Goliath himself. In this case, David's real name is Eun Yong. He has risen from a penniless, simple young man to become the CEO of a private-equity fund who successfully speculates astronomical sums of money. Together with a team, that for him is family, too, he takes on a financial cartel in which politicians and especially the public prosecutor's office are also involved. Thus, it is not played fairly. On the contrary: it is actually life-threatening.So, at first glance the plot doesn't seem to promise much that's new. Nevertheless, ""Payback: Money and Power"" offers a dense, strong story, with expressive play and impressive spirit. The haunting presence of the mimes in front of a rough, gloomy background is haunting. To be honest, I paused for a moment - not sure whether I really want to know and see everything or rather drop. Eventually, I couldn't help it, couldnt let go of it. I WANTED to know and see. The impression, the KDrama left with each episode, was just too powerful... And I'm thoroughly glad about it. A great story. With a considerably cunning plot development. Despite the underlying bitter seriousness an invigorating (for all the refreshing poetic freedom - e.g. not everyone is as talented, tactically adept, self-confident and yet grounded in a good balance of heart, mind and soul as Eun Yong) and encouragingly optimistic perspective.Oh, actually, here's another premise I forgot to mention at first...-But what a relief that the law still exists... and also those few, who stick to it, believe in its value and power, and thus keep fighting for it with wits and passion..."

Is the chemistry between Jae Hyun and Jimmy good? Sure. They are cute. Yoon Oh and Peach as characters have good dynamics with contrasting personalities. But is this enough to watch the show?I feel like the show tried to portray the subjects of loss, regret, miscommunication/lack of communication. How some people can be so focused on their own feelings, they cant see other people and the truth that is there. It all felt extremely flat though. Having not much screen time, its not wise to add many plot lines and side characters. Pick one main and one side plot and develop them as well as you can - thats the way to go. Quite a number of things make no sense. Peach staying at his dead friend's house, and no one questions it. The investigation of the police was a joke itself. Yoon Oh can manipulate objects in real life, since his mom heard him playing the guitar, but its not really brought back for them to communicate with each other in any way? Give him a laptop, making him type! Peach flirting with the air with the people around him. These are just a few things that happened without proper explanation, and were there just for the sake of the plot progression, even though they made little sense. The biggest let down was Yoon Ohs relationship with his mom. It would be an amazing plot for his character development and driving force of the show, but they decided to just resolve it in the first half of the show and bring it back at the end. This should be the focus! The quality of the acting depends on the actor. Jae Hyun for sure does well in his role, while Jimmy struggles quite a bit. He has improved a lot since his Why R U days, but I dont think he has yet reached the level worth compliments. Got to love them dry crying scenes. The drama is for sure pretty. Saved quite a few screenshots. The cafe scenes were just aesthetic heaven for me. The soundtrack was also one of the better aspects of the show. All songs were fitting the scenes they were used for. Overall, it was all just misdelivery. Not once have I felt sad, even with such an emotional topic.

The drama The Beauty Inside was an attempt to replicate the success of the fantastic Another Oh Haeyong and Perfume seems like an attempt to make another Beauty Inside (which was quite entertaining still), the story is very similar, but the drop in quality is just too much.  Lee Minky is not a good actor, he can only play one thing, which is essentially himself, but that character was a good fit in This is My first Life & The Beauty Inside as well. Now in Perfume Shin Sung Rok was trying to be Lee Minky essentially, even though it was not terrible, but it wasn't really enough.  For reference this actor played the main villain from the classic drama My Lover From the Star, which was actually a great fit for him.. I was already kind of a fan of Go Won Hee, after seeing Welcome to Waikiki 1, but I think she shouldn't have been cast for this. Make no mistake she did pretty well, I just think that this role was miles outside of her comfort zone. A 40 something woman, who wanted to commit suicide, because of  all the atrocities life has given her gets to opportunity to become young and beautiful again, sure fine, but the end result shouldn't have been a perky, go lucky Go Woon Hee, I don't think.  Now about the story, it's pretty typical in some ways. We have the dumb puppy second lead type, who just keeps pushing, pushing & pushing. Basically the writers just added the most typical classic kdrama triangle possible. Some common tropes were blatantly copied from famous dramas, for example they've taken the mysterious liquid thing from The Secret Garden (even the set and the music are super similar for those perfume related scenes), then there is the love triangle cohabitation from Jealousy Incarnate and some others.. Also I don't believe that the abusive (ex)husband character needed so much screen time in a romcom like this. Had the show been really funny I could have ignored most of the above, however it wasn't. The physical gags involving the ajumma form's obesity were almost offensive. I'm fine with watching fat/obese ppl on screen really, but this path of trying to make fun of them isn't very nice, though I do understand that in Korea fat women are shunned quite a bit more than in the west. Overall there were very few really funny moments, which is such a shame with an actress like this, who is basically a comedy goddess, or something along those lines.Had the romance been good I could still have enjoyed this quite a bit, but the chemistry between the leads was at best average. There are also major problems with how their relationship progressed, or rather regressed at times. There is just so much push pulling. From ""I have decided that I love you, even though you are not Her""  we go to ""I just realized it was Her all along whom I've loved"" then rinse and repeat.  For those that watched the episodes as they aired this might not have been as annoying, but I watched the entire thing over the course of 2 days.  TLDR: I don't exactly regret watching the drama, but I don't feel that I've had quality entertainment, will never consider rewatching."

The drama setting is a school, and it doesn't have any foul language or situations that would be considered unsuitable for the younger crowd.  It does have some fighting but it's honestly more exhibition style fighting than actual violence.The show is based on Yu Na and her new-found friends, working together to retrieve the 7 phantoms that have been released into the world.  The phantoms are basically the embodiment of human sins or emotions, such as greed, fear, anger, etc., which take over their classmates one by one.  It has to show itself in order for them find and capture it.  There is a question as to why they were released in the first place, and whether the good guys are actually the good guys, but it's obviously left open for another season to answer those questions.  It was pretty simplistic and easy to watch.  Of course there were plot holes, but I think the writers were trying hard to fill in the major ones without giving the entire story away in the first season.  The interaction between the characters was good, and there weren't any cringe moments, which is always a plus. I saw in the comments where people were talking about how cringey some situations were, but I didn't have that reaction anywhere in the show.  I just thought it was cute, and I was happy for a break from the angst, lack of communication, and Drama (with a capital D) of other shows.

A lot of the dramas I watched had me heavily binging.This one did not.Every episode dragged a bit for me. I was even dismayed that the villain was announced in the 10th episode. I seriously did an eye roll.  There was no shock factor in the reveal.The plots were lackluster and the villain behind the whole ordeal didn't even solve the problem. The punishments for the evil doers failed miserably.I'm the type of person who wants justice in these dramas but a lot of the ones I've seen have completely missed the mark.I didn't care for  most of the time that whiny MFL. I couldn't understand why the villain cared so much about her. It was like having a crush on a wet paper bag. Plus they tried to make the MML and the MFL have a spark but that quickly flamed out-which I was glad about because I don't care for the rom-coms.As always the last episode did no justice.

Initially I liked the premise, but the show lost it's charm quickly. I think it was just too over the top at times for me to take it seriously, with super silly comedic parts, lots of dramatic tears, and a plot that tried to do way too much. Once I gave in to the style of the show, it started to become more watchable, but I never really fell in love with the story.

One issue is that I think there are too many main characters to focus on, making the story initially confusing, and it took way too long to set up all the relationships. It didn't help that I didn't find the characters lives very interesting until much later, and I think the cast is partially to blame. 

I had a lot of problems with the overacting, and almost every cast member is guilty of it. Kim In Kwon and Kim Soo Ro are both charming in their roles, and I love their bromance, but they barely have screen time compared to the rest of the cast even though it's their story. Instead we have to rely on Rain and Oh Yeon Seo, who also have good chemistry, and are super cute eye candy, but their overacting multiplies by a million when they are together.

The only person I recognized in the main cast (and that was barely) is Rain. Rain looks so physically different that I didn't realize it was him, and I can't forgive his hairstylist for it. I loved Rain's cuteness in Full House, so I thought that would be a good sign. He has a lot of charming and adorable moments, but his dramatic moments were pretty bad. On the other hand, I did not remember Lee Min Jung being in Big, because I tried to block that show from my brain forever. She is equally unimpressive in this. She does share a few cute moments with Rain (very tame romance), and the cast playing her family (which I loved), but her dramatic moments were mostly a bore. Little Lee Re was the opposite, and made me cry several times. She was a much stronger actress than most of the adults. She should probably give her drama mom some lessons. 

Oh Yeon Seo was hands down my favorite cast member, and I think she stood out as the only one able to handle the comedic and emotional scenes. Lee Ha Nui on the other hand was my least favorite. She is gorgeous, but her acting is comedically bad. I often laughed while she cried, making it hard to sympathize with her. Her character was also annoyingly arrogant, which doesn't help. Together they had a little bit of chemistry, but since it was so obvious that the show would stay far away from anything that came close to resembling a lesbian relationship, they never seemed like two people who actually loved each other. Then there's Choi Won Young as the one note bad guy, and the perfect bad acting match for Lee Ha Nui. I think I mentally skipped all of their scenes together. I would rather watch Lee Tae Hwan stand there... that would've been much more captivating

The other problem is that the story is super ambitious... unfinished business and revenge, 2 love triangles, gangster rivalries, family drama, family secrets, celebrity scandal, a chaebol war, oh and the whole afterlife thing... and it takes a long time to get it all straight. The writers do a good job of making all the pieces fit together eventually, but It wasn't until the halfway point that the story started getting interesting to me. There were a few moments when the writers managed to get me in the feels too, in spite of my not being that into the story, and I did tear up more than once. The fact that this drama did get more interesting as it progressed, instead of getting worse, is impressive though, and having a pretty good ending made me not regret watching it till the end. I also think it might even be better to watch it again after knowing all the characters, and the plot twists. 

My favorite part of the show may actually be the soundtrack, which had a lot of tracks that I really liked on it. The Moonlight track in particular, which grew on me like the show did. 

Overall, ""Please Come Back, Mister"" was not bad, but it's not good enough for me to recommend either. I don't think those who dropped it like I did are missing anything. I also understand why those who like the beginning episodes, and kept watching, gave it such high ratings. If you do decide to watch it, and you love the first 4 episodes, you will probably really love it by the end. Otherwise, I recommend lowering any expectations of greatness. I'd say don't take the story too seriously, trust that everything will eventually make sense, ignore minor plot holes, and give in to the bad acting moments. 

For me it was the perfect filler drama to watch while waiting on episodes from more intense on air dramas - Oh, and Rain is often shirtless, so that's a definite BONUS. At the heart of this drama is a lighthearted look at how we live our lives, and how we effect those we leave behind when we go. Sometimes we may need to yell at the screen about what a stupid way to die that was, then relax and watch a drama like this, in order to remind ourselves what is truly important."

Police Academy is a fairly lighthearted  approach  to the detective and crime genre- sweet and surprisingly heartfelt in parts, comical in other scenes and undeniably with more irritating flaws also . So this leaves the ultimate question; is  Police Academy worth watching? The acting front is solid  enough  here. There are a few slip-ups when long dialogue pauses or line deliverances felt a little mismatched against foregrounded scenes, but  Jung Jin Young certainly exceeded expectations as main lead Sun Ho. The  idol actor added a level of angsty-sweetness to his onscreen persona .  Sun Ho was a subverted example of the   main lead with a tragic past. He didnt follow the stereotypical routes taken in fiction of being jaded, arrogant or the  apathetic prodigy but a fairly normal and confused  teen. There were some surprisingly touching scenes ( never to be explored or seen again )  with surrogate father figure Yoon Taek II ( Oh Man Seok) as well as his fraternal-style relationship with  best friend Yoon Seung Bum( Choi Woo Sung) helped to foreground some functionality within Sun Hos everyday life. However for our main character to befriend  fairly positive influences such as Seung Beum and deal with a pretty austere paternal figure such as Yoon Taek this ultimately begs the question; Why and how did Sun Ho learn to hack and get involved with the authorities  ?  Theres the argument by some viewers that "" it is a take your brain out comedy"" and   Sun Ho did so because he was bored"", however, the show never really tied this major point concisely.  Perhaps  it wouldnt be too bad if the drama hadnt carried this over more as an important role in later episodes with sporadic and partially-inaccurate terminology and tech setups , only adding to the confusion as to Sun Hos involvement in this world  . This then leads us to talking about   his reasons for training to become  a police officer . A character doesnt always necessarily have to go down the  vengeance backstory route, but it was an odd move that the drama didnt interlink or at least explore more about Sun Hos backstory, his parents as well as some sense of relief and poetic justice for Sun Hos  goal to become  an officer . Aside from  the prosaic  reasoning in the show that  the girl I like is pretty and can fight , I want to have a goal and follow her too.On this subject  theres evidently also the problem revolving around Kang Hee. Idol actress Krystal isnt too bad here. This is admittedly  not one of her most captivating performances, but not unwatchable either. Our female lead  Kang Hee  is a bit of a mixed-bag.   Despite being Sun Hos ""dream girl"", Kang Hee does have a more evident character drive   than Sun Ho in parts. Her  mother is far from being a good citizen and Kang Hee has often put academic pressure  on herself to succeed in order stray away from being labelled as her mothers daughter. ( A relationship which was given a patchwork happy redemption arc later on without a lot of explanation)However heres where we hit a major rut with Kang Hee; she isnt a  likeable  character. Of course we are supposed to like her in theory . Shes intelligent, a talented fighter and witty. However the problem with the female lead  is that whilst she does have a complicated  past which helps to explain  some of her motives, she never seems to  learn to grow, accept or develop. Perhaps it wouldnt  be too bad if the show pointed this out or made Kang Hee mature by accepting her own mistakes or begrudgingly understanding  the errors of her ways, but  sadly Kang Hee rarely  escaped her one-dimensional character depth throughout the drama. Then theres the potential   onscreen relationship between Kang Hee and Sun Ho. The setup itself is simple enough; Kang Hee is Sun Hos crush and  his raison dtre. The female lead  has rarely noticed Sun Ho up until the storyline of the series, but this soon changes when events begin to unfold. Its a straightforward  enough concept and whilst Krystal and Jin Youngs onscreen chemistry was decent  enough, the relationship often hit a rut due to a lack of definitive development as well as hitting an anticlimactic conclusion.Meanwhile away  from the problematic  romance factor of the drama theres  then the  topic to discuss about  Yoo Dong Man ( Cha Tae Hyun) also. Aside from serious questions being raised about how Dong Man wasnt picked up by any of his colleagues for his initial attitude to Sun Ho, Dong Man is your typical seemingly  gruff and arrogant cop with a heart of gold. It was evident that the drama would go down the route of exploring Dong Mans gradual buddy friendship with the male lead and it was undeniably sweet. On the other hand  there was lot left in the air about exploring more complicated depth with Dong Mans character; his past,  rivalry, rookie days and his own complicated feelings when the antagonist is revealed in their midst  was often left as unexplored territory. The antagonist(s) and climatic tension of the drama were fairly predictable- not bad per say, but simply existing for the sake of  plot drive rather than being given depth or more prominence. As a consequence  the ending was quite anticlimactic. Sweet and on a happier note than possibly viewers were anticipating but nonetheless cliche and slightly disappointing. Whilst  Police Academy did offer some enjoyment through its impressive cast lineup  and style, the dramas ability to tackle character writing, depth and plot tension and climatic build  seemed sporadically thrown together and lacklustre often resulting in anti climatic solutions or endings . Overall  Police Academy was mediocrity at its best- okay if youre watching just out of boredom and not bothered about writing during a binge-watching session but those looking for a drama with an enjoyable police buddy element and depth may want to look elsewhere."

Set in the same context, a journey of a female politician to the top of the ladder and how she negates all the hurdles.The basic story is that Lee Jeong-eum is the newly appointed Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Previously an athlete, she is relative new to this political arena, only to be showered with all types of problems at the beginning of her new role.On top of all this, her husband is also kidnapped and she has to resolve this situation before it blows out of proportion.A political satire/ dark comedy series, this drama focuses on the journey of Lee Jeong-eum and her underlings. The first few episodes were very slow, but the last 4 episodes were right on the money.The story felt like a half-baked plot. Certainly, there were many things which warranted more detailing.But lacking story was made up by the perfect acting and the dark comedy.It really put into perspective how the government actually runs. There are so many permutations and combinations that a politician have to calculate in order to successfully complete his/her term spot-free.What I liked was the character development of Lee Jong-eun. From a naive athlete turned minister, to a master manipulator, her journey was very spectacular. She learned from every betrayal, from every incident, and in the end she was able to successfully negate out of this whole controversy.The second season is going to be very interesting.Overall a nice drama. A good 8.5/10 from me. That being said, I don't get why this drama got so many Baeksang nominations, and that too for Best Drama.My sole motivation for watching this drama was because it got the Best Drama nomination, but as with most other names, I don't agree with this nomination either."

It has a good cast and I like the ML when he stars in other shows. The FL is quite good at playing a sassy girl as well. It should be a sure fire hit, right?The answer is a bit more complicated. The Show starts strongly. The opening scenes are impactful with some quite confronting. We have two leads who are hurt and damaged by the machinations of others. Both lives are derailed, and their future seems to be full of uncertainties and trials.   The Show is patently a healing drama with a strong dose of romance. The chemistry between the leads is unmistakeable from the start. The show largely delivers on its premise, but it is not without caveats.Part of the problem is that the Show drifts from one motif to another without fully committing to any of them. There is palace intrigue which is full-on at the beginning but faded mid show. Comedic elements pop up from time to time but you can hardly call it a comedy. Medical dramas run right down the centre. Some cases are interesting but most are just fillers. The whole Joseon psychiatrist thing is a bit of a deception. The ML still based his diagnosis on checking the parent's pulse and countenance. Treatments are centred on acupuncture and herbal tonics. He does think more about the circumstances of his patients, but I'd call him mindful, insightful rather than a neophyte psychiatrist.The love line is oddly nebulous as well. Not that the leads are confused about their feelings. If anything, they knew exactly how they feel about each other, but the show just wont let them take the leap. I don't want to use the word draggy to describe this show and it is not, at least not in the classical sense. It feels more like a lack of resolve. It is as if the show is buying time, rather than wasting time. This might well be because the show is renewed for a second season before the first season is even over so the writer-nims might be under pressure to keep a few tricks up their collective sleeves for S2. Characterisation is a mixed bag. The leads have clear identities, and their portrayals are largely on point. The support cast is more one dimensional with most of them employed as comedic relieves. The antagonists are a tropey mix of local pompous bully and power-hungry grand vizier type. They brought forth death and destruction, but the intrigue is more pedestrian than Byzantine. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the Show. All the ingredients are in the pot, but it just simmers and guggles. Never quite come to a boil. It is good but not great. To be fair, the Show concluded satisfactorily at the end of S1 with retribution and redemption dished out appropriately. It didnt quite end in a cliff-hanger but more like a ridge-hanger.Bring on season 2! Hwaiting!"

Also the circumstances in which he started working in the clinic. Also the last episode will make more sense if you've seen the first season.The second season was quite enjoyable for me. There was more focus on psychiatry in the second season which was one of my biggest complaints with the first season. I personally enjoyed this season more. Though there was some good mystery in the previous season as well. Don't be turned off by the SFL as her part is not much. But the SML can be annoying. The thing that bothered me is why Man Bok's character was not properly used. It didn't make sense.There is more romance in this season but don't expect too much. Most of the time it is just awkwardness and spending time with each other.If not for the finale, I would rate it as 8.5 because I was entertained. The final episode was underwhelming. Missed opportunity of cashing in on the couple that everyone wanted to see more of. It was overall sweet. Just missing some bang or maybe that's how I usually expect finales to go.I actually didn't think I would even watch the second season after the first but I'm glad I did."

And just when you thought that maybe things will be overturned later, you ended being disappointed and wondering why on earth you even bothered watching this. Like seriously, the moment the villain starts getting clingy with the main pairs and wanna get the guy to kill his girl just to justify his own belief and started killing off every tom dick and harry around the main character the plot gone to the trash already.  The villain becoming too overpowered to the point of ridiculous and the side characters acting stupid by not heeding the main character's warning to not confront the villain direct and ending up being killed stupidly as well. And the ending was so anti-climax that you can't help wondering if the writer themselves gave up in making the story be decent. Which was a shame, since the earlier plot was decent only to become a trainwreck at the end.This is as bad if not worse than a lot of western b-grade horror with dumb main characters and overpowered psycho villains.Tl:dr, as much the initial story sounded interesting, don't bother watching this. Please watch other much better dramas seriously. Like say, Ghost Seeing Detective Cheoyeong was good.

There are two massive plot twists close to the end that make the majority of the plot redundant or have the plot have no effect on most of the characters. The stakes were non existing. There was quite literally no character development, not only for the mains, but also for all the supporting characters.Maybe, if the finale was stronger and had a nice conclusion, it could make the show decent, but the last 4 episodes were painfully bad and rushed. They tried to connect all the dots (there weren't really that many dots to begin with if I must be honest) in the last 15 minutes, so when the show ended I just sat there and asked myself: that's it?Soo Min was an amazingly annoying character who made mistakes and had to be saved right till the end of the show and, with how the plot was written and structured, it was impossible to actually give him the development needed. He was the center part of the plot and the only one who truly was affected by everything that was going on.The supporting cast was quite nice, but yet again, all the characters were more or less ruined by that one unfortunate plot twist.The good?

That sort of drama isn't typically up my alley. But coming from the writers of the Reply series, I thought maybe there was a chance for it. And then, after hearing glowing comments about it on my feed for weeks, I got more and more curious. (And after a slight doofus move on my part - I finally found the correct show to watch. :P) I was drawn in from the beginning, and if it were not for responsibilities and work....well, I may have been glued to my tv day and night until I was finished. At around an hour and a half long per episode, this was NOT an easy show to binge on. I wanted to, but it was practically impossible for me to do. This show ended up being a warm, full of heart, slice of (prison) life 'dramedy' that is almost entirely character driven rather than plot driven. If that type of show is something you enjoy, please give this a chance, I don't think you'll regret it. The writing for this show was first class. I hesitated to give it a 10 just because I tend to get 'post show glow' as we MDL'ers like to call it. But I settled for an overall 10 with just a fraction knocked off for storyline and rewatch values (this show is LONG, did I mention that??) This story flowed so well, with proper use of flashbacks to fill in the missing pieces. There were some things I didn't think would be realistic in a prison, but some things which were too heartbreakingly realistic. I loved the relationships that the writer created and getting to know the motivations of the characters. Overall, I think the writing was VERY well done. I audibly laughed many times and then mopped up my tears through the last two episodes - both happy and sad tears. Prepare your tissues for those, folks! Although we didn't get a firm ending for everyone, I felt that, in a way, that was realistic too (and maybe, there's a chance for a second season down the road??) and I wasn't overly upset with that lack of closure as I normally would be. It made sense to me in this story, and it was enough for me right now. The acting from the cast was worth every minute. Who would have thought they could draw this much sympathy from me for criminals? I loved how Je Hyuk, who was quite lacking in common sense, was so shrewd at reading people and knowing whether they were really a good person or a bad person and how to deal with them accordingly. I've only ever seen Park Hae Soo in one other show and that was a supporting role that I didn't remember. But I will definitely be looking forward to seeing him in more after this. I thought the chemistry between Park Hae Soo (Je Hyuk) and Krystal (Ji Ho) was excellent. I absolutely would have watched them do a straight up romance drama with these actors playing these two characters. And I always think that I'm not really fond of Jung Kyung Ho, but then I always end up liking him when I watch him. He was very likable in his role as Lee Joon Ho, and I liked his bromance with Je Hyuk and his romance with Je Hee. I loved all Je Hyuk's cellmates as well - I can't even choose a favorite. I liked them all for varying reasons, Min Chul, Han Yang, Captain Yoo, KAIST, and Crony. Then there was Lt. Paeng, the best corrections officer in the whole pen - and his proteg, Song Gi Doong. Wonderful performances from all the actors of these characters. I really have no complaints for the acting at all. Sometimes, even down to just facial expressions was perfect. The music was very fitting and fit just the right emotions for the scenes, and I feel like I need to go back and listen to some of the songs again. The re-watch was knocked off a bit just for those long episodes (did I mention those yet? LOL) but, time permitting, one day I really do want to go back and rewatch this again."

When a  Sageuk is done right it can take me on an emotional roller coaster, and this one did exactly that. On the surface it's everything I expect from an epic historical drama... family rivalries, betrayals and revenge, blinding greed, tragic martyrs, obsessive love, a star-crossed romance... Yet, It also holds it's own among two of my absolute favorite Ancient Joseon Sageuks (The Princess' man, and Empress Ki). Although there are similarities that fans of those dramas can appreciate, I think this drama still stands out on it's own because of it's memorable characters, and touching story.  First, It's not a spoiler to say that this is indeed a Romance-Tragedy. It is inspired by the true story of Queen Dangyeong, who we know from the title, was only Queen for a week. If the title isn't enough to clue you in on what's in store, the show starts by glimpsing into the future, and we see a not so happily ever after moment where she tries to kill her love, the king, but can't. This was the same flash forward method that grabbed my attention in Empress Ki, and I knew that I would need to know exactly what road led them there. That road is not just filled with tragic moments. We actually go all the way back to childhood with the characters, and the journey to the end is more than just tears. There's humor, great friendships, some action, and of course romance, and what I thought was an interesting story of 3 people who's lives are controlled by their fate, in spite of their feelings.  I think Yeon Woo Jin was amazing as future king Yi Yeok. I've liked him in other dramas, but this one is a perfect vehicle for his range. He's matched with Park Min Young as Shin Chae Kyung, who I can say the same about. I think, because their child versions were so good, it gave them a lot to work with as far as backstory, and I truly believed all of their moments together. They may not have the most exciting chemistry, but that didn't stop me from liking them as a couple. The triangle is then made complete by Lee Dong Gun as Yi Yoong. I think his character, and acting, drives this whole drama. He also reminded me A LOT of a young Christopher Walken, and not just because of his big eyes. He has a charm and creepiness about him that made him the kind of villain I not only sympathized with, but sometimes rooted for in spite of myself. Even in his most over the top moments I totally felt for him. I really am a sucker for an actor who's really good at playing evil or crazy or both.  Most of the story revolves around the rivalry between these two brother for the crown, and their love of the same girl, but it still didn't feel too clich to me. I think it's because every single character in this story, meaning every single supporting character, are so developed and well played, that it gave extra depth to the story and made me care about everyone... EVERYONE... even the Nanny. I would usually give a shout out to awesome supporting characters but there are just too many to name! I also loved that most characters, even if they were minor, had some kind of attention given to their specific part in the story, and some very emotional endings for their characters.   Ok, I will mention just one... Hwang Chan Sung as Seo Noh. *insert my standing ovation here*  As for the story, for me it just kept getting more exciting and addictive as the show progressed. The moments that may have felt slower were more of a build up to more exciting parts. Waiting for new episodes started to feel a little like torture, but sometimes I needed that week to breathe between episodes because the story got so intense. Sometimes characters were frustrating, but I think that's what added to them feeling human. Sometimes the political storyline was upsetting, but because it tied directly to these amazing characters, it kept my interest till the very end. The ending had a lot to live up to, and I think it was well done. I suffered from severe eye rain during the second half of the last episode, but the ending avoided just being completely depressing, which I think is impressive.  The music is beautiful and compliments this drama very well, and Junggigo's song will be on mental loop for a while.  Would I watch it again? Absolutely. I would probably need to watch a few light hearted shows in a row first, but sometimes you need a story that gets you in the feels too. I would just stock pile some tissues.  Overall I would definitely recommend this, BUT if you are not a fan of extreme drama then this may be too much. If you have never liked a sageuk ever, know this is more of the same, so don't expect this one to convert you. If you don't like stubborn characters who make you want to throw things at your screen, you definitely picked the wrong drama. Personally, I think it was beautifully bittersweet, and I I already added it to my favorites list before I even finished it."

This is the third Korean drama that I watched that had a sequel to.I watched the first QOM series and I fairly enjoyed that and was a bit nervous about it's sequel.When I watched the first episode of the sequel I was going to drop it because that episode was all over the place. I was thoroughly confused and was wondering if it was going to stay in that direction for the next 15 episodes. I was very close to dropping it but after the second episode I  ended up binging on the rest of the episodes. Again this series focused on several criminal situations that needed to be solved and I liked the way it was done. What I didn't like though was the last episode. It was a mess.  It seemed as if the writer had a hard time trying to come up with a way to end last episode so they threw in a little bit of this and a little bit of that and what was left was a hot mess.  I wonder why Korea always have a hard time ending their last episodes in these dramas.  Especially if it only have to do with one plot! It seems that there will be a third QOM because several plots weren't solved in the last series. I hope that's the case because I most definitely liked this series.

I was excited to watch this because, same as most others, I wanted to see Kim Seul Gi in a lead role. I wish it had been in something better than this. 

Kim Seul Gi was adorable as usual, so her acting carried this show. Ahn Hyo Seop was just a pretty face without much substance, and the same for Yeon So Hee. Pretty much all of my acting points are given solely because of KSG.

I think the story really failed to teach the moral that it seemed to set out to do. I read that someone compared it to 'Shallow Hal', and in theory I thought that would have been a good comparison. However, the characters did not evolve much past the ""beauty is everything"" mindset. I think this story could have so much better, but the writers blew it. There were two good ways they could have handled the ""true beauty is on the inside"" moral, and they did neither. I was pretty frustrated with the main male lead and his character's basically non-existent growth. I feel like Mo Nan Hee had a tiny bit of growth, but only related to her own sense of self-worth and not in how she, herself, saw her object of desire. She was almost as superficial as the guy. 

The music I didn't notice much, so it must have been serviceable.

The mean characters were plenty, and some of them were even playing friendly when they were in reality the worse. Some others had tragic endings, so the tragedy genre was plenty in this one. So, the girl's adventures and how she managed to survive the twists and traps that the other contestants set for her were entertaining and spiced up the story. The chemistry of the couple was amazing, too, and they had a nice romance. Their romantic scenes were pretty intense and they had plenty of kissing scenes, which is often rare in historical dramas. Though, the love triangle they wanted to present was not as good and it was underdeveloped.However, the second part was predictable. It was pretty much what happens to all historical dramas, the bad old aristocrats want power, the girl wants to protect the king, the king wants to protect her, and so on. The ending was okay, but boring. Finally, the main character was good, but she got annoying from time to time, especially in the end, even though she started as a strong, sassy character.

Let yourself get both annoyed & inspired by politics behind the scenes  What a wonderful power show inside out politics. Yes, it's ugly and you might want to smash right into it. Often enough and plentifully. But it also has its heart in the right place. Repeatedly. Dealing with politics may make you doubt the meaning and purpose of democracy. But it doesn't get any better without those intrepid heroes willing to stand up for a better world. One may sometimes lose faith in something like a democratic gene in people. But one can always hope and fear. The game is only over when it is over. The election is not over until the votes have all been counted.Stupendous women. On both sides of the front. And the men? Oh well. So and so. (And if many people complain about Lee Geung-young because of his scandal, he at least prefers to choose the role of the challenging guy, where one can wholeheartedly consider him disgusting...)Well, I consider the sisterhood thing being  the crucial message for me in this story. Yes, there are strong, competent women, who, against better female instincts, cling to old structures and customs - in the wake of the Jaebol clan. Yet there are those competent, motivated, witty, loyal to higher ideals women, too, who are sharing those ideals with others and walking side by side. Even if tempted and seduced they still sense what is right and wrong and act on that when in doubt. Using and abusing (interchangeable lackeys) for personal gain vs. appreciation and recognition (of brothers and sisters) are very sensitively compared here as common HR strategies and management styles. With 11 episodes (only), Netflix slips through the story fairly quickly - only the most necessary things about the protagonists are given. However, especially the actresses don't let the story rush past you. Kudos to (in this case in particular) the heart and soul of the Ahjummas and a storytelling that, while strikingly handling the political landscape for its stringency, nevertheless spreads the complex mixture of motives, hopes and fears in a well-sorted manner.Does the end justify the means? This age-old question apparently never ages. ""Queenmaker"" makes you think, but also often leaves you terribly annoyed about the way things are. The KDrama makes you angry, demoralizes, and yet: at the same time it gives hope. Strong women, a strong story, an often enough an ugly world in which, however, once again each individual contributes to the fact that it could be one way or another...Obviously I would recommend it - if youre in the mood for something like that.  And: obviously there are no Idols and no Love Story involved. People may die, but it is no crime story.  It isnt funny, either.  Nevertheless, I would say, you should check it out and let yourself get both annoyed and inspired by politics behind the scenes."

I thought the first episode was a little depressing, and kind of weird. The characters were interesting though, so I wanted to give it another chance. By episode 2, I knew that this was a drama worth watching. Ho Won is a very sympathetic and relatable character. I loved the friendship between Ho Won, Ki Taek, and Kang Ho - they never got competitive with each other and were always genuinely happy for each other. Seo Woo Jin and Ho Won both showed good character growth through the series. I love how Ho Won influenced Woo Jin for the better. The office politics were not boring or heavy, and the office characters were interesting even if they could have been fleshed out better.My main complaints about the show were that I felt that the show didn't leave enough time to adequately answer all the questions it raised (I feel like this show could have been extended by 2 episodes easily), and that I wished there had been a tad bit more romance. The romance in this show is VERY minimal, but also very sweet and just beginning to blossom. The sweetness of it is why I was disappointed that we only got the tiniest taste of it before the ending. The show's main focus was the office relationships and politics, and they did those parts well. The music was not standout, but must have been serviceable. I didn't really notice it much.This was a good office drama, with both funny and touching moments. There are lessons to be learned about how to live in the moment, that we need to do what's right even when it's hard, and not to give up when life gets tough. Even with some flaws, it's still a good choice and you won't be mad you watched it."

(The story doesn't really start to go anywhere until around episode 6.) Although I love both lead actors, the first couple of episodes were sort of awkward, and I wasn't sure how I even felt about it. I wanted to support the actors, but the drama was just sort of...meh. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. It was just average, and that's why it got a 7 overall for me. I rated much lower for the storyline because everything except the main lead parts and their romance was just superficial.That was the one part of this show that I really did enjoy - seeing Soo Ho blossom and become his true self under the care of Geu Rim. I like that Geu Rim was the mature and stable person in this show. She didn't have really any character growth because she didn't need any. She was calm and forth-right. She always had the perfect response to Soo Ho's (and PD Lee's) childishness. There were no huge conflicts and no noble idiocy, just a pure and sweet romance (the radio part of the show was almost an after-thought after the first half of the show and seemed to take a backseat instead of being anything  major to the story.) Soo Ho could be very possessive and jealous, but because he was so child-like, cute and innocent about it, I really couldn't muster up any indignation over it. I was happy that Geu Rim was a woman that didn't let the men (Soo Ho and PD Lee)  get away with bad behavior without calling them out on it. Here is where the not so great part comes in. The story-line was problematic. The side characters really didn't have much to do, and their parts in the story were too shallowly developed to bear any weight in the story. While that made things very comfortable and easy for our lead couple, it also didn't give them any true conflict to resolve, which bored many viewers. I was ok with riding along this easy river of romance because I liked the leads honesty with each other and their resolute determination that they wouldn't let things come between them. The 'villains' that the show set up just sort of petered out about 3/4 through. Towards the end, they decided to make these thorns more sympathetic and less troublesome. Most things were resolved in neat little bows for us, very tidily and quickly. And the rest was sort of just let go.  If the pacing had been better, I think they could have written a stronger story that would have been more compelling for us as viewers. Instead, they weakened out their own plot and it was already thin to begin with. I wasn't bothered by the age difference between the actors as some people were. I am well aware that an actor doesn't have to be the same age as the character she plays. I had no issues at all with the leads that they cast for this. Now, I do have to say that the first several episodes, I wasn't thrilled with the styling choices they made for Soo Ho and Geu Rim. Soo Ho had some horrendous red hair - and red eyes to match. However, with his transformation, I could kind of see that maybe they were making an allusion to him becoming more of his 'real' self. Geu Rim also had hideously poufy curly hair and this served to make Kim So Hyun actually appear younger than her actual age rather than older, as her character was. Thankfully, they also toned down this style and she became more believable as a woman in her early 20's vs. a high school girl. For what it's worth, if you are just looking for something light and don't mind an extremely shallow plot that just serves as a backdrop for a comfortable easy romance, then I would say this is what you are looking for in a rom-com. It's nothing ground breaking or 'never been done before', and it can be pretty clich, so know that going in. If you are a jaded viewer who hates that sort of thing and/or needs something faster paced and a more solid plot, then you are going to want to take a hard pass on this one - it won't be for you."

Really gorgeous hanboks, great fight-scenes, scenery, and a really good soundtrack that I can add to my writing playlist. But that alone doesnt make a good show worth the while.

Often there is also a very specific atmosphere surrounding sageuks and other period shows. For me they tend to much more about heroism than modern shows, which I enjoy. But I felt like Rebel did manage to do much more than that.

The drama talks a lot about the ideology of the Joseon era, about these different social classes and some have even pointed out that it was critiquing some things that are happening in politics today. But while I did appreciate and enjoy that, that wasnt really what I took, liked the most about the drama. I was more intrigued by these character-journeys that the drama took us on.

I really enjoyed how almost all of these characters got to be very layered individuals. They were not just the hero, or just the evil gisaeng, or the old lady that is just there to cause the hero some trouble. They got to be more than that. And Hong Gil Dong didnt just wake up one day and decide to be the hero of the people.

Sure, a lot of the side-characters didnt go through much personal development and kinda just went with the flow of the story, but all of the main characters, who the story revolves around, get to have some say in the story and have some meat on their bones.

Even the women, which usually get the short end of the stick in these shows, got to be ambitions and not always nice, but the drama did a very good job in explaining why they were doing the things that they did. As well as what had led to that. And they werent just good or just evil.

Having the bad guys in these shows sort off simple really works, sometimes. Like in Marvel movies, where the story really isnt about them. But that wasnt the case with Rebel. Like I mentioned before; these people have ambitions and flaws, and all sorts of things, and I feel like the shows does a good job explaining that and not really shame them for it.

Some of the characters show up and you think that they are rather nice, but then it turns out that they arent as nice as they seem. I really liked that in Six Flying Dragons, and I really liked that here.

Since Rebel is a very character-driven story, it can get a bit slow at times. Since the characters are moving the story along, appose to the story moving the characters along.

The first part of the story is more about Hong Gil Dongs father and it setting up a lot of things. He was a very interesting, gray-like, character. And when the narrative shifts to the main hero, Hong Gil Dong, the show changed a bit. It became a little slow at first, before picking up the pace again.

I would say that the middle part of the drama was probably the weakest part of the show, for me. I felt like it was a bit too slow. It lost me a bit, or I wasnt as invested as I was at the beginning. But around ep. 20 (I want to say) the story really hooked me again.

And looking back, I can appreciate the slow-build of the middle a lot more. There was a lot of great buildup going on there that just exploded in the most exciting way toward the end. It constantly kept me on my toes. It was great."

""Reborn Rich"" brings a breath of fresh air to the Jaebeol milieu. The story plays with ""time and space"" and at the same time deals with a highly topical inssue of the time: the meanwhile flattening turbodynamics of economic developments, which as a result of the Asian crisis positioned South Korea as a pioneer of the digitization age at the top of the world. The story comes at a time when the first melancholic fatigue is spreading in the country. It is fascinating how the creative industries at this point in time cheerfully holds up a positive, optimistic, innovative blueprint (i.e. the web novel Youngest Son in the House of Jaebeol was followed by the film adaptation as a series).The country's audience ratings went straight through the roof. After half the episodes they had already tripled and there was no holding back. The story hits the mark. The rights have also been generously released on international streaming platforms. The story about far-sighted, intelligent, courageous, ambitious and at the same time ruthless entrepreneurship draws wide circles and inspires worldwide. There is a lot of optimistic esprit in it, all about a spirit of growth that is actually predicted to be in danger of dying out in the form we are familiar with. In any case, lively ideas for innovation and intrepid capitalists rock the show in ""Reborn Rich"". Brilliant dramaturgical move: the patriarch of the very first hours of the Jaebeol meets with the young, new, digital zeitgeist. Charming. Tough. Mischievous. And in their mutual intention to increase profits far-sightedly, grandson and grandfather are one. The recipe works: relaunch and remake of the Jaebeol heroes from the very beginning. That gives hope and a good mood. Just in time.In fact, the government actively decrees and supports innovations, subsidizes technical subjects at universities with large sums of money, cuts humanities institutes and puts 'all in' on the growth sectors. However, even though two-thirds of young people have a university education, 12.5 percent of the employable age group up to the age of 29 cannot find a job in the early 2020s. The last time the figures were so sobering was during the Asian crisis. And: society is aging. Although the gross domestic product is currently (in early 2020s) still growing, at almost 3% per year, it is far removed from the dizzying dynamics of the post-Asian crisis years and their GDP figures, which were three times higher.South Korea's conglomerate founders still have hero status. But the proven system is exhausted. The following Jaebeol generations make life difficult for each other with inheritance disputes and live out their practically ennobled status with self-love. They have long since lost sight of promising, visionary growth, social responsibility and national well-being. New promising impulses are needed. ""Reborn Rich"" finds a successful form of expression for this difficult national emotional mixture.Born into the Jaebeol Dynasty, the youngest grandson of the Soonjang Group's founder is not a spoiled Jaebeol, but an intelligent, hard-working, creative-thinking, adaptable young man who originally (before his sudden rebirth) was employed in 2022 as a CEO assistant in the service of the Soonyang Jaebeol (actually as a Senior Finance Manager) - he was not only quite smart and busy but got harassed a lot too. The founder of the company and now (in his second life) his grandfather was actually a role model for him. The grandson thus already knows his biography almost by heart. Reborn again under the Jaebeol sky he becomes a clever lawyer and investor who can hold a candle to his 'grandfather' at eye level.(Admittedly, there is somehow also a bit of cheating, because the youngest grandson distinguishes himself with his considerable entrepreneurial genius based on knowledge from the future, which gives him not inconsiderable advantages in competition with the rest of the Jaebeol clan...)Nevertheless, the ambitious fake Jaebeol grandson would be one that the country needs today. Socially responsible. Grounded. Visionary. Brave. WITHOUT (!) the filth of the otherwise mostly elitist Jaebeol offspring. Instead, WITH the fearless, highly motivated and visionary esprit and good/lucky timing of the first Jaebeol, who brought prosperity and prestige to the country in the people's narrative.The issues, challenges and problems facing the Soonyang Group mirror an entertaining historical outline of South Korea's turbo-dynamic development phase, which led the country into the highly digitized consumer paradise of the last almost 2 decades. On top of that, Justitia may also take some space in her difficult fight against corrupt networks.In ""Reborn Rich"" old energy meets the current moral of the times and, practically in a combative spirit of sport, struggles about the constructive economic attitude for new, forward-looking impulses. ""Reborn Rich"" promises plenty of fun, sanity and series enjoyment against a serious background. The poignantly portrayed grandpa-grandson dynamic is also brilliantly cast with Song Joong-ki and Lee Sung-min.A snappy series, definitely worth watching.-----------------------------------------SIDE NOTE: --- Background: Asian crisis in the 1990s and the IMF in South Korea ---The Asian crisis of the 1990s brought South Korea to the brink of national bankruptcy. Banks, as well as large and small companies had to file for bankruptcy, many people lost their jobs, their assets and their prospects.In South Korea, however, there is significant talk of the IMF crisis. That's because people saw the tough conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which amounted to massive interventions in the country's existing structures, almost as colonialist attacks - like the Japanese did back then. In fact, the IMF provided South Korea with the largest loan to date ($57 billion) to save the country from ruin. At the same time, the people, motivated collectively by patriotism, made unique sacrifices that went as far as selling their own gold in the service of national gain and the consistently disciplined renunciation of export articles. The combination of financial help from outside, internal discipline and willingness to make sacrifices as well as targeted economic restructuring measures maneuvered South Korea out of the recession at amazing speed and torpedoed the country into the unimagined prosperity (on credit card basis) of a first-class digitalized consumer society. The country is still living from this today, but the air is slowly getting out...-----------------------------------------PS:Never mind the ending... it could be this or that or something else, here it is this...quite mind blowing...whatever... the circle is round after all...and the journey is the reward, isnt it..."

I have complaints. I had hopes and they were crushed.The first few episodes made me so happy. I was in heaven with the cute and fun interactions between the characters. The romance was sweet and down to earth. Jung Ha was able to fight for her rights, Hye Joon stayed true to his morals and Hae Hyo was on the way to cross the villain line. And then nothing happened.There are quite a few plot lines here; basically every character gets one (Ha Myung Hee must be Oprah wannabe or something), but none is truly explored nor well established. At first, this messy and unbalanced way of directing and editing seemed charming to me. Life is messy and unbalanced you know. I liked how some important plot lines were not explained right away, but, for example, we got a whole scene of the female and male leads discussing how one should apply hand cream. It worked coz I was sure the plot lines will be slowly addressed as the drama progresses Sadlyl, they werent.All the characters were rather poorly written, though had great potential to be amazing. Hye Joon is boringly perfect and everything works out for him. Jung Ha has a great 180 closer to the end of the show, Hae Hyo was truly useless plot wise. All the supporting characters were there filling the space, but their motivations were never explained. Why do they do what they do? Who knows?It had its moments. Park Bo Gum crying? A+. Well, that would be it. So now, lets drop some SPOILERS! How did the relationship between Jung Ha and Hye Joon go from perfect communication and understanding each other, to never communicating what they truly want and feel and making all the decisions on their own? We had so many dramatic plot lines that could bring the tension in the last episodes, why add new bullshit one?Why introduce Ahn Jung Has mom into the picture when this story was never truly explained nor explored? She just shows up to give Jung Ha an excuse to be sad and cry, and then she is gone. They ONCE mentioned how Jung Ha has problems accepting help because of her mom, but it was never mentioned again, it has no meaning in the story itself.Why did they never do anything with Won Hae Hyo? He was neither good, nor bad nor gray. He was just kind of there. How interesting would it be to actually see more of his internal struggle between being a loyal friend and disappointed actor?Why give us a side romance between Jin Woo and Hae Na? Probably the most useless plot line in the whole show. This could let us explore more of the controlling behavior of Kim Yi Young or be another burden for Hae Hyo: one friend stealing his spotlight, and the other dating his little sister and hiding it, pushing him into I have no one I can trust state of mind and explaining his feelings for Jung Ha, who was always honest with him. Why did they never truly use the Charlie story? It was always somewhere in the background, but at the end it had no lasting consequences on the characters at all. When dating make up artist affected Hye Joon more than having a famous designer as his gay sugar daddy? Where is the logic? Why even add the story when it was never important to anyone?Kim Su Man was painfully dumb.The ""2 "" aka the boring ending.Thats it. Not really. But I have no strength left to write more.

Tangled ties of fate and trauma that continue to get even more tangled and traumatizing. You might think Yeah. Makjang again. Family drama again. Forbidden love again. Ok, youve seen it all. You dont need another one. So should you watch? You definitely dont have to. But oddly enough: you may want to. The characters, with all their sometimes almost disturbing ambivalence, drag and pull you under their spell. Subtly, unperturbed, whether we're watching or not: they are struggling to function and survive within their dysfunctional relationships and families... and on top of it: they are even longing for far more than that.2022/23 ""Red Balloon"" infiltrates South Korean homes as the red-hot contemporary document of a complicated ordeal, which society increasingly has to deal with. On the one hand, family is regarded as the highest value in society. On the other hand, within the last decades national divorce rate has reached the tops in worldwide comparison. Yet, divorce is still seen as a shame  a topic for other families only (if at all). Nevertheless, more and more South Koreans are choosing this path, even the 'elderly' (those over 60 and even over 70) are increasingly opting for divorce. The KDrama juxtaposes the hardened socio-cultural fronts within a fictional story that listens to both sides equally, gives space, allows themselves to be rubbed against each other  sometimes loudly, sometimes violently  and struggles to find solutions.Throughout the KDrama, events and emotional ordeals continue to get worse. Seasoned with gradually increasing makjang tension, with complex personality portraits, as well as poignant, excellent pleas (sometimes for one, sometimes for the other and sometimes for yet another position), the KDrama screws itself deeper and deeper into the increasingly heated minds of the audience. ""Red Balloon"" succeeds excellently in taking its often head-shaking viewers into truly impassable, controversial socio-cultural terrain and, with the concentrated confrontational dramaturgical charge of emotional ambivalence, exemplifies what would be, could be, yet must not be, however wants to be possible, (and after all IS possible in South Korea 2022/23).There are multiple storylines that are heartily intertwined. But they all deal with the same topic: the critical fine line between a so called satisfied life (as one normally lives / should / has to live / pretends to live) and a self-abnegating, self-deceiving dissatisfied life; the latter mostly going unnoticed, though, because actually everyone lives that way and it seems to be the most natural thing in the world... Dissatisfaction only becomes critical, if someone can no longer ignore that this supposedly satisfied life is actually a 'dissatisfied' one. The subtle psychological tension of the KDrama emerges in the conflict between traditionally unquestioned, accepted customs and the individual urge for deviation, which (here) rages more or less intensely in almost all of the protagonists, and erupts in an attempt to break free. Daring to dream, being honest with oneself and eventually even making the necessary efforts... but, alas, also being sincere in respect to the social environment? Ready to disappointing the expectations of others? Prepared to missing duties and responsibilities? To hurting loved ones, too? Has actually anyone ever honestly tried to truly walk along his/her individual path sincerely upright? (At least when it comes to South Korea 2022/23, so far there are hardly if any role models whatsoever.)""Red Balloon"" can be considered a social study using the example of the microcosm of three families, that are connected, among others, through a (not quite balanced) childhood friendship between two female protagonists. Yes, one could bitch and nag about prevalent adultery among the protagonists. On the other hand, in this case Id like to set a different focus, that is: Collectivism in conflict with increasingly burgeoning individualism. Against this background, it is more about the 'art' of becoming an egoist. (See side note below). In a society shaped by collectivism, social class and hierarchy like South Korea, 'egoism' (=standing up for individual needs, even in the face of social pressure) has so far not been a quality in itself. On the contrary. The development of such an independent and socially recognized value is in its infancy there. The protagonists are correspondingly insecure and sometimes stumble, doubt themselves, look for a turnaround and reflect on the old values... which include: doing what other, older, financially better off fellow human beings say, want, demand. (And thus, often enough being humiliated, too. A life full of sacrifice, humiliation and shame is quite normal. Most people live that way. Accordingly there is nothing wrong with it, right?)Shameless adultery might be one side of the medal. The other side, however, represents the widespread, customary long ignored individual dissatisfaction for the sake of the group (family etc.) that some can no longer cope with. The KDrama team draws memorable portraits of people at different ages, who have their quirks like anybody else. At some point, they try to stumble free from the expectations of others and rather follow their gut. They want to, and choose to live up to their own desires... struggling, staggering, falling in the face of the mercilessly blowing headwind. There might be an urge to break free of a tight corset of expectations and obligations  yet, just daring to think in this direction is considered shameless and despicable... Sympathy for family struggles, sacrifices, deprivation and suffering, on the other hand, is widespread, because this individual pain results out of self-sacrifice for the 'group' and in this case is downright virtuous. (The KDrama Orbit has told countless stories of this virtue since the earliest productions.) Sympathy for 'individual' pain however, e.g. suffering from the group pressures and demands, is hard to find. With a newly found egoism and its associated pains one is left alone... Well, has been, so far. Not anymore. This is where ""Red Balloon"" comes in at least with an example of role models on fictional playground.With its tricky, controversial topic, the KDrama hits the mark of many minds in the country. The audience of ""Red Balloon"" had quickly doubled and after half of the 20 episodes even tripled. Eventually, for the audience throughout the rest of the world it offers plenty of KDrama-Quality, too. --------------------------------------SIDE NOTE: --- Life satisfaction in South Korea ---The latest data on quality of life, published by the Republic's statistical office in 2022, ranks South Korea 36th among the 38 OECD countries. (Only in Turkey and Colombia life satisfaction is worse.)What feels like exaggerated makjang for some (especially for audience with nationalities of the other 35 member states) is pretty close to everyday life for many (South Koreans) sitting in front of their home TV...------------------------------------------SIDE NOTE --- The art of being an egoist ---In 1976 the book The Art of Being an Egoist by Josef Kirschner was published. In it, the author works out the necessary, ambiguous psychological process and the stamina, the required perseverance, you need regarding individual (=egoistic) life decisions that are geared towards personal needs (=against the interests of the community/group/family). Self-love is a crucial step towards accountability (vs. behaviour determined by others) and thus forms the basis for free, responsible, caring citizens. However, even after all those centuries, egoism is (still) widely devaluated in individualistic Germany/Europe, too. Thats because, egoism and the group are generally at war. The more submission the family/group/society structurally expects of its members, the less space individual needs have and the more shameful and banished they are. The protagonists in South Korea 2022/23 (which is characterized by collectivism and has a strong hierarchical structure) have to deal with just this problem. The theme here is the struggle for a psychologically healthy egoism for one's own good. The thesis behind: Honestly towards myself and content, I am able to approach others sincerely and freely give of myself, contribute and care about others. Thats because I want to. Not because I have to, (even though I feel wronged, indigent or missed out.) I care for myself. And then, additionally, I can truly care for others, too. Like the sign in the airplane says: you should put your oxygen mask on first before trying to help the person next to youPS:(This 'egoism', which is based on self-love and mature personal responsibility, should not be confused with insatiable, ruthless and mostly immature greed. KDrama-orbit is full of greedy contemporaries, because unfortunately greed is cross-culturally human and can thus be found all over the world. Greed has no social component. With greed, nothing positive flows back into the group.)--------------------------------------"
Red Shoes,,,8425,2021.0,2021.0,100,,,,"A story about a heartless mother who betrayed her father and turned away from her sick younger brother for love and desire, and a daughter who dreams of revenge against such mother.(Source: Naver) ","Choi Myung Gil, Jung Yoo Min, Park  Yoon Jae, Shin Jung Yoon, So Yi Hyun, Sun Woo Jae Duk",KBS2,"I have no idea why I kept watching   This was not a revenge drama. Instead, it is about a dysfunctional family at its core. People who are selfish, ruthless and place a good deal importance on ambition. Gemma was one of the lamest female lead I have seen. All she did was act like a teenager with a temper tauntrum. While she ranted and raved about 'revenge', she was in many ways just like her selfish parents. She also didn't really get her revenge at all and others instead did the work. Along the way, everyone she used, including hopping into fake/real relationship with three men, were magically onboard with poor old Gemma and no one was angry with her. Even though she was like a bad hurricane that just created havoc with her emotional yo-yo, characters still felt for Gemma -- but most of the viewers did not. The drama was weirdly watchable mainly because of the veteran actors who really essayed a couple who both hate and love each other. For some 30 odd years, their relationship status has been  ""complicated"". The star of the drama ends up being a late entry -- stepson Ju Hyung -- who had some hilariously witty caustic lines. So if you are looking to see a drama about a dysfunctional family tearing each other apart, secrets coming out after years and cold ruthless people finally getting broken -- this is your drama. There were some interesting questions and themes but it never really got fully explored.  The main point of the writer seems to be -- unbridled ambition and greed can be devastating and the chickens will come to roost even if years later. The choices you make may come back to haunt you years later. Anger leads to more anger and revenge just creates more revenge. Better if people just communicate. So fair warning to anyone thinking of watching -- it starts off interesting and then.... you have no idea why keep watching."

There are points where the story is seriously dragged out and with the same things happening over and over again. This drama was advertised as being based on a book, but I did some googling and discovered that it was based on a short story and not an entire book (the short story collection is also called reflection of you) which honestly explains why the story is so dragged out - there simply isn't enough content to last 16 episodes! Aside from the plodding pace, almost all characters in the drama are portrayed as unlikeable, unsympathetic, with virtually ZERO redeeming qualities.  Even the kids. Everyone is so bad that I felt myself rooting for the affair couple in the show... which is making me reflecting on my own morals right now lol.  This drama has a very typical makjang plot centered around the theme of extramarital affairs, betrayal, love... you get the idea. Nothing groundbreaking. Except the woman who got cheated on (Gu Hae Won) is the most unlikeable person EVER. Even worse than the ""third party"" Jeong Hui Ju.  Why? Because our introduction to Hae Won is where we see her while working as an art teacher, slap the shit out of Hui Ju's daughters Lisa who happens to be a student in Hae Won's class. It is later revealed that Hae Won being an art teacher at Lisa's school isn't a coincidence at all, and her main reason for slapping Lisa was to kickstart her revenge plans and punish Hui Ju for having an ""affair"" with her husband. It's hard to retain any ounce of sympathy for a woman who decides to viciously assault one of her students just because of a past transgression by said student's mother, and when viewers did not even know about the supposed ""affair"" at the point of the assault. Haewon also does other scummy stuff like manipulate one of her student's deadbeat dad into kidnapping Hui Ju's other kid, resulting in prison time for deadbeat dad. She also manipulates said student into taking secret videos of Hui Ju's husband and Lisa. Compared to this, Hui Ju is a saint, whose only crime (not counting her actions in the last ep) was just being an unfaithful spouse and a terrible friend who just wanted to have a live in boytoy while enjoying the perks of being a chaebol wife in peace (LMAO)The reason why ""third party"" and ""affair"" are in quotation marks is simply because the show doesn't adequately explain Hae won's relationship and her husband (Seo Woo Jae). They were described as getting married for the sake of obtaining a visa.  Hae Won addresses him as ""sunbae"" throughout the show and there were no scenes of  where he treated her as anything more than a friend. She on the other hand, is obsessed with him, if anything, it  was an unrequited love relationship on her part. So how does one feel sympathy for a woman who is supposedly being ""cheated"" on when she isn't technically in a relationship in the first place? Though to be fair, Hae Won did mention rather obliquely about possibly having a miscarriage after Woo Jae went to live in Ireland with Hui Ju, which brings me to my next point of critique: WHY DO ALL THE CHARACTERS NEED TO SPEAK IN SUCH A CRYPTIC WAY?????When Hae Won first starts harassing Hui Ju, she goes on and on about Hui Ju needing to apologize yada yada without actually saying WHAT exactly she wants an apology for. Of course, at the start the show needs to build suspense and wouldn't reveal all the events that happened but COME ON. This dragged on till literally episode 10 at least. She/Hui Ju refuses to speak about the affair when it's plain as day she is referring to it. They dance around the topic, talking in circles about forgiveness, being wrong...waxing poetic about pain and suffering like they were philosophizing about the root of mankind's suffering when the crux of the issue is just one woman stealing the other woman's husband.  This really boggles my mind. If Hui Ju was actually sorry she would have apologized YEARS ago, not now. And if she was actually a decent person she wouldn't have had an affair right? So what's the point of all these apologizing bullshit? Seriously.  And Hae Won had evidence of their infidelity too. She could have gone public and ruined Hui Ju's reputation and career as a high profile artist but no...her solution is to stalk Hui Ju CONSTANTLY, make cryptic comments, ingratiate herself with Hui Ju's friends/family  for some reason and lastly...reintroduce an amnesiac Woo Jae to Hui Ju JUST SO HE CAN CHEAT ON HER WITH HUI JU AGAIN. To add to the frustration, all these long winded conversations occur when the characters (Haewon, Hui ju, Hui ju's husband, woo jae) ""unexpectedly"" run into each other. The frequency of these run-ins make it seem like they are living in a small town with a population of 500 people instead of metropolitan Seoul. Because what in the world????  Yes it's a show but it doesn't mean all logic flies out of the window. The frequency of these run ins drop off after episode 11 but no, the frustration does not end. Because Hae Won still miraculously retains the ability to be in HJ's proximity at any critical juncture, especially in the last episode. With superpowers like that, who needs revenge plans? She should have just straight up teleported to Hui Ju and just murdered her. Plot critiques aside, the only bright spots in this drama are the acting,  cinematography and OST. Shin Hyun Bin is excellent as a  self-righteous mentally deranged/traumatized woman and Go Hyung Jung is excellent at portraying a repressed chaebol wife who shows no remorse for her infidelity.  The OST is sublime and while I won't rewatch this show, I will definitely be replaying the OSTs. TLDR: woman gets cheated on and decides to get revenge in the most ridiculous way possible. watch world of the married for more satisfying revenge plots instead."

And more or less anything else you can imagine. There is truly nothing these angry woman are not willing to do to get what they want or kill them all while trying. What I love about this drama is the pure evil, the corruption, the twists and the feeling of wtf... and can a person really be that evil (apparently yes). All keeping my interst to click on that next episode and binge it in less than a day. However I did feel that the ending was a little bit predictable and kind of rushed and would have wanted another episode or two to wrap things ups a bit better. Another thing I did not like about this drama was the crying rapa narrative, as these types of things often discredit woman who have actually been raped as most women will not report this patly due to fear of accusations of crying rape. I find it kind of cute that a man who says he only sees women as vessels for sex, somehow is the most allegeable bachelor out there... That woman, mothers heck politicians  keep fighting for. While there actually is a rich, handsome guy out there who nobody seems to want to give the time of day? However for a drama not listed as a romance it actually has some pretty decent romance, feelings and unrequited love here and there. At least if you are willing to believe these people have the ability to love which I am not really sure of... Not really the type I would want to be part of but entertaining to watch. So to sum it up, this very short drama delivers what it promises, has some pretty interesting characters and is indeed fun to watch. It may not always make sense and it may not be a masterpiece but it does the job and will cater for all your evil, corruption and revenge needs."

The family of the drama is one whole consisting of so many unique people. There are moments they are good and moments where they behave terribly and yet, they remind us of how they are also human. These people define a family- being together through the good times and bad and cherishing each other no matter what. I happen to be a person glad to be living in the 21st century but this drama made me wanna go back to the 80's.

The romance may have been the main part in the previous two installments but this drama overall outdoes everything on every level for me(opinions may differ for all). I can only call this drama a masterpiece because NEVER have I ever seen or read or heard of such a story in my life before. This drama made me think about the beauty of relations and what kind of love is love. It is a story about remembering the past and being grateful for what you possess.

The OST happens to consist of old songs remade and it is another beauty that only enhances the drama. Every single song is jjang and goes with the mood of the drama perfectly. 

When it comes to the cast, the casting was perfect. Hyeri was given such hatred in the beginning but I knew she'd be good. But she really exceeded my expectations too. All other cast members were also cute and Jin Joo will always be my favorite kid. <3

The story in spite of being so beautiful, was flawed. Towards the last quarter of the drama the characterizations went bad and some plots drug out too much. Trying not to focus on the romance at all in the drama kind of ruined it in some ways. The romance was cute but the love triangle wasn't executed properly. I think it's okay because whatever the writer wanted was accomplished. I found myself changing ships midway and Deok Sun indeed ended up with the one I wanted her to be.

This drama was a real charm and gave me 10 memorable weeks which I shall never forget. I'll always rewatch this drama and watching it in one go would be a treat, because it was a torture waiting for every week for the subs to come out.

As the show progressed, I gradually grasped its true essence and the message it sought to convey. Instead of focusing on evil spirits, the writer expertly exposes the horrors that lie within human beings, the darkness that surfaces when desires and greed take control.The drama raises the question, Are humans any better than evil spirits? Unfortunately, my answer is no.Throughout the series, we witness the sacrifices of innocent children by the male lead's grandparents, resulting in their own children paying a heavy price for these malevolent acts.While revenant may not feature numerous terrifying or chilling moments, it excels in showcasing the evils hidden beneath the facade of human existence.From the very first episode to the last, the show's storytelling captivates the audience, luring us in with compelling twists that keep us eagerly anticipating the next episode. It undoubtedly secures its place as one of the best currently airing horror thrillers.Kim Taeri's performance is nothing short of exceptional, as she impeccably portrays the conflicted Sanyoung, desperate to understand and eliminate the evil spirit to save those around her from harm. Equally mesmerizing is her portrayal of the malevolent spirit Hyangi, making her character's transition captivating sight.While the both male lead characters of Yeom Haesang and Lee Hong Sae may not have impressed me as much, they failed to create any big impact on my mind. I had loved Oh Jung Se and Hong Kyung's performances in previous dramas but here they were OK.Kim Hae Sook's portrayal of Hae Sang's grandmother Na Byung Hee is a great addition, delivering a standout performance, especially in Episode 11. Here she is even more wicked than her previous character from Under The Queen's Umbrella, sparing neither her son nor husband from her malevolence.In conclusion, Revenant captivated me by skillfully narrating the tale of evil residing within human hearts, ingeniously intertwined with ghostly elements."

As both leads have extremely depressing background stories to make the audience feel both a sense of urgency and protect them in all coast type of deal...Lomon and Seo Ji Hoon rocked this roles where very well written, consistently good interesting,  and defiantly stole the show not only for the show of abs but actual substance they did a great job but I would have wanted to see a lot more screen time with Seo Ji Hoon. The Others acting, characters and story was kind of inconsistent, some scenes where great others not so much. Shin Ye Eun had som great scenes but there were times where she did not really convince me, I also found her character annoyingly stupid at times as she changed sides more often than a pingpong boll during a tournament. However her chemistry with Lomon was lovely, and she is overall a pretty bad ass person (whenever she is not acting stupid). Most of The  Other girls were pretty cool most of the time, complex, lovable and showed great friendship.  Lee Soo Min was however better than her role, which was a bit to stereotypical mean girl... She did of course rock it but I hope to see her get casted for better roles.  Chae Sang Woo could use a lesson or two in acting, and though his character did make me wonder  I still feel that there was something missing...  There drama presents a few social issues here and there but they do not really get in to them as well as show an inconsistency in funding, illogical solutions, illogical situations, illogical decisions,  so yes a whole lot of lack of logic and  bunch of loose ends too for that matter. The amount of times the male lead gets hit in the head is ridiculous, and I am pretty sure some of those blows should have been lethal. That said  this is a drama that actually had me guessing pretty much from start to finish, no that there weren't any clues they were just very wide spread so it was actually a challenge to put all the pieces together which I like. The OST is lovely so is the cinematography but the filming will also give you motion sickness at times. So what can I say this was a pretty ok watch, one i would recommend whenever you feel like watching pretty people fight, splatter blood and stay a step a head of the police while trying to solve not only one but several mystery's while falling in love... this is not a bad place to find it, just do not expect to much logic or  any kisses."

The wordy title ""Revolutionary Love"" already hints that this is about a Romance. But this title also contains the second plot line: the love that leads him to revolution - to resistance and struggle for the rights of irregular workers in the company of a powerful Jaebeol. One way or another, Byeon Hyeok is at the center of events - as the eldest son of Jaebeol of the Gangsu Group, who is in love and choses the barricades (and new ways) within the corporate culture of his father's business group.Basically, the topic of such a labor dispute is rather socially critical and highly explosive, because there is practically no legal representation for the irregular part-time workers in South Korea. The number of non-regular employees is four times higher than among the other OECD member states. Employment relationship is not well protected. There is no union representation. Irregular employees usually only receive about half the wages of a permanent employee. The time limit is barely a year. Since the Asian crisis, this form of employment has proven to be cost-saving and convenient for small and large companies, so that it has been retained on a large scale to this day. ""Revolutionary Love"" cleverly focuses on this aspect of the South Korean working world as this critical topic is sort of camouflaged with a lot of slapstick and speed on the humorous note  ... and of course there is the romance...The role of Byeon Hyeok is a showpiece for Choi Si-won, who, with his wide array of physical, wordless visual grimaces and gestures, softens the actually frustrating labour dimension by Korean standards to a level that makes it accessible to the masses on public cable TV (and 'permissible' for the powerful). At the same time, Choi Si-won has the necessary sincerity to also show his sensitive side and create space for the closeness of a romantic relationship. In contrast to the comedic character of Byeon Hyeok is his 'friend' Kwon Jae-hoon, whose leitmotif seriousness can hardly be surpassed. In between, the head of the ""revolution"" whirls: the street smart Baek Joon.""Revolutionary Love"" is a KDrama that is often underestimated by Western viewers in its ambitious socio-critical and labour policy claims. It knows how to touch with the protagonists' love triangle despite the labour dispute mission. Yet, be aware, it is not your usual RomCom."

Even though I ended up absolutely adoring it, it really isnt for everyone. The first ~15 episodes are painful - not because they were poorly executed or portrayed poor acting, but because watching the way the characters treat each other is just awful. After the death of the 3 sisters mother is resolved, the plot really does improve. All of the characters get fleshed out and each one grows and changes for the better. Yes, in the beginning the daughters are particularly awful to their father, but the whole story is about their growth as daughters, sisters, and women. You come to understand them, why they turned out the way they are, and witness their beautiful metamorphosis when they see the faults in their ways. Watching the sisters feel awful toward their father upon realization of their horrific behavior is the most heartbreaking, yet satisfying part of this drama to watch.I will be completely honest: the first ~15 episodes had me wondering if I really wanted to watch Revolutionary Sisters. The murder/mystery genre really isnt my thing - add that on top of the despicable treatment of the father by his 3 daughters and it really was a tough call. But, as shameful as this sounds, it was the affair of the oldest sisters husband that kept me going. At the time, I was the most angry and disgusted with her (the oldest sister, Gwang Nam) behavior. She was awful to everyone and stuck up. But the affair tears her apart as a person and it destroys her world. She humbles due to the new hardships she must face on her own and really changes into this beautiful person. I identified with her the most and I adored her story with her husband the most. My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years. I could really sympathize with the feelings that Gwang Nam experienced in her position, as the oldest sibling/daughter and in a long-standing committed relationship. No, my husband and I have never *knocks on wood* had to deal with infidelity, but the raw feelings and struggle this couple experienced, I could feel compassion for.To be clear, I dont really care to watch a drama revolving around characters who are cheating, but this was so different. Maria, the woman Gwang Nams husband cheated with, took advantage of him once while he was black-out drunk and conceived a baby (lets say it how it is guys). While hes not innocent of adultery and lying, he still sincerely loved Gwang Nam, he was just stuck between a rock and a hard place of doing the right thing. And through finding out about her husbands affair and recognizing her responsibility and role in their failed marriage, Gwang Nam realized how much she still loved her husband. But it was too late. Things couldnt go back as they were because a baby was now involved. Watching her come to terms with the aftermath of his affair and letting each other go had me sobbing like a baby. I cant imagine going through that, but the feelings hit right like they should. From there on, I had to know what happened to them.I next liked the second sister, Gwang Sik. She was the best out of the 3 sisters to start. She was a little too perfect for me, but her flaws, albeit relatively minor compared to her 2 sisters, became more apparent once she became married. Her romance with the aspiring trot star was pretty adorable and left you with mostly happy feels. The way their relationship impacted the prior generation was sad, but I think it turned out right. And Gwang Tae. I *disliked* her for the majority of Revolutionary Sisters. She was manipulative and conniving. Money was the most important thing to her and I just dont identify nor sympathize with that. Her constant business with the loan sharks didnt impress me either. She just came across as youd expect of the youngest sibling: spoiled, whiny, and used to getting what she wants. BUT in the last ~10 episodes (after her huge blow out with Gwang Sik), she really turned a new leaf (and things kept happening that kept positively impacting her character, which I approve of). I personally feel that her romance was the most shallowly written as I didnt feel the build up of emotion and feelings as distinctly as I did for the other couples, but by the end, I really liked how they grew together and supported each other despite their flaws. I especially love how she defended her brother-in-law. At least shes loyal! :DThere are many other characters in Revolutionary Sisters, but since its a family drama, thats too many to analyze in my review here. But theres someone Id really like to mention...Young Hee - the woman who finally makes Appa, Cheol Soo, happy towards the very end of the series. I love her happy demeanor, her loud, but classy style, how shes attracted to Cheol Soo and how she wants to take care of him. It was so nice to see him happy and treated so warmly considering how poorly he was treated by his wife and how unhappy she made him. I was so happy that Cheol Soo finally found happiness with someone.The conclusion of the drama was done through multiple time jumps - 8 months later, another year later, etc. I both liked and disliked this because it was a bit odd to have so many time jumps, but seeing the sisters with their families, plus seeing how the other characters and extended family were doing was nice. Unfortunately, there were 2 loose ends that werent resolved to my satisfaction: What happened with Gwang Nams father? Who was he and is it really okay for Gwang Nam to think hes passed away?What about Aunt Bong Ja and her love, Dol Se? I know things were complicated with Gwang Sik and Ye Seul being married, but we didnt even get to see resolution with their matching necklaces... In regard to music, I enjoyed the music, especially the instrumentals! They were well selected and well placed to really build the scene. So overall, I *would* recommend Revolutionary Sisters, but warn that the first quarter of the drama is truly difficult to stomach; have patience and itll pass. You really need that awful beginning to adequately depict the character changes that occur over the course of the story. If you can get through the beginning, it seriously pays off. I will definitely be rewatching."

Does she have what it takes to realize her goals, or will the price prove to be too much to pay?(Source: Viki)~~ Adapted from the novel “Princess Pyeonggang” (평강공주) by Choi Sa Gyu (최사규).","Choi Yoo Hwa, Kim Bup Rae, Kim So Hyun, Lee Hae Young, Lee Ji Hoon, Na In Woo",KBS2 Viki ViuTV,"In terms of acting, production, storyline everything is close to being perfect. The story of a simple love story of a fool On dal and a princess recreated into a powerful story about power and sacrifice.  the story progress steadily and gradually. The battle scenes were exceptionally good and quite interesting to watch. In short, rationally speaking this is a good drama.About replacing Ji soo with Na in woo, although I initially found it disturbing but later came to the conclusion that Na in woo was a better choice after all and the actor did an amazing job of portraying our lead character on dal. But truthfully the first thing that came into my mind by the 20th episode is ""thank god it's finally over!!"". For me, this is emotionally exhausting. River where the moon rises is about a fight between clans for the throne. In the midst of it is a princess who uses the love and devotion of her lover and wields it as a knife for power and personal revenge.  Princess Pyeong Gang never cared for the people. instead, she used on dal and his entire clan for personal revenge and to keep her family in power. in the process not only on dal lost his mother but also many others, only for it to all end up with her a**hole of a brother to sit on the throne.  To use peace for the 3 kingdoms as justification, the process was too acute to accept.  I guess this is where the word ambitious princess comes in.What was even more depressing is that while caught up in the power game she completely ignored On Dal on several occasions and refuse to notice his suffering. When he finally left is when she regrets it. Here every character in the story is driven by a personal vendetta while sugar-coating it as love and sacrifice and I found this emotionally exhausting."

Main female lead Eun-Gang( Chae Soo-bin-  Love In The Moonlight,  Im Not A Robot and  Where Stars Land) is a bubbly, optimistic and outspoken individual. Often having felt left out by her parents due to their seeming preferential treatment of her sister Go Mi Gang ( Son So Mang-  Queen Of Mystery 2,  Mr. Queen), Eun-Gang  has often felt pressured to take up a career which will gain her parents respect. Eun-Gangs prayers are finally answered when she discovers that her first-love has enrolled in the academy in order to become a police officer. Determined to enter the academy in order to get close to him as well as earn the respect of her parents, Eun Gang seems to be living the dream. However, reality, as Eun-Gang soon discovers, can often be harsh. Meanwhile the narrative introduces viewers to main male lead and Eun-Gangs polar opposite, Wi Seung Hyun( Kang Daniel). The level-headed and reserved son of top-ranking officer Wi Ki Yong (Son Chang Min-  My Fair Lady,  Pride and Prejudice and  No Matter What), Seung-Hyun has felt the need to uphold the reputation of his father, ex officio. However Seung-Hyun and Eun-Gangs worlds collide even prior to entering the academy. After an awkward first  encounter, Seung-Hyun and Eun-Gang are shocked to bump into one another again at the Korean National Police University. However as the polar opposite main leads become involved with one another on a gradually frequent basis at the cadet academy, Seung-Hyun, Eun-Gang and their peers soon find themselves  facing dilemmas, chasing dreams, and struggling to comprehend feelings on the front line of duty Rookie Cops is the creation of screenwriter Lee Ha Na. The same writer behind predominantly melodramatic productions such as   Cunning Single Lady and  The Time We Were Not In Love,  Rookie Cops attempted to offer viewers the best of both worlds; a lighthearted youth series through Ha Nas signature vivid tone, as well as a moody cop drama revolving around crime and emotional dilemmas for the main characters. Admittedly this was necessary to a certain extent for viewers. Despite a noir-style opening,  Rookie Cops was heavily invested  with  giving  an introduction to its main leads  Eun-Gang and Seung-Hyun, as well as introduce the other  key players to the scene. In particular these reoccurring characters and fellow students of the academy  included   apathetic as well as studious  Ki Ha Na ( Park Yoo Na-  My ID Is Gangnam Beauty,  SKY Castle and  True Beauty), athletic judo prodigy Kim Tak ( Lee Shin Young-  Crash Landing On You,  Bite Sisters and  How To Buy A Friend), eccentric yet passionate Woo Joo Young ( Min Do Hee-  Reply 1994,  My ID Is Gangnam Beauty and  Clean With Passion For Now), sprightly   social butterfly Yoo DaeIl ( Park Sung Joon-  Sweet Munchies and  Run-On) as well as amiable student Shin Ah Ri ( Cheon Young Min-  Foolish Mom,  Whats Up With These Kids!? ) and  principled youth  Seo Beom Joo (  Voice 2,  A Piece Of Your Mind and  Military Prosecutor Doberman).  In addition to the students, Professor  Cha Yoo Gon ( Kim Sang Ho-  City Hunter,  Kingdom and  Sweet Home),  Professor Bang Hee Sun ( Choi Woo Ri-  Queen In Hyuns Man,  Matrimonial Chaos and  The Bride Of Habaek) as well as Dean Kim Soon Young( Seo Yi Sook-  Youre All Surrounded,  Mother and  Hotel Del Luna) played active roles as the reoccurring members of staff at the University.Nevertheless it was noticeable that the second-half of  Rookie Cops shifted in tone in comparison to the first half  ;  angst-ridden and with a several surprising plot twists, though admittedly a little inconsistent at times due to quick-paced events.As mentioned previously, Chae-Soo Bin and Kang Daniel star as the main leads of the series and deliver fairly consistent  performances throughout. ( It is admittedly  praiseworthy to point out  that despite  Kang Daniels good reputation as  a celebrity talent host and soloist,  Rookie Cops marked the idols first acting debut onscreen.) As for the main leads onscreen romance , Daniel and Soo-Bins potential chemistry is admittedly stunted at different stages of the narrative. In the first-half of  Rookie Cops, shoehorned embarrassing scenarios and encounters were purposefully placed to enforce tension and awkwardness between the main leads onscreen. Yet its hard to deny that as plot progress,  Daniel and Soo Bins onscreen chemistry is admittedly  a lot more natural also. Then  theres the supporting cast. Although there were admittedly several  moments of overblown dialogue, the supporting cast delivered  fairly solid  performances. In particular, Lee Shin Young,  Park Yoo Na and venerable actor Kim Sang Ho particularly stood out due to their charisma onscreen.As mentioned previously,   Rookie Cops is  divided almost  into two-halves  by its tonal shift; a fairly easygoing introduction ( aside from its initial opening), gives ways to a darker second-half with several unexpected twists and revelations for viewers. The first-half of  Rookie Cops admittedly downplays a lot of initial tension from the opening, as well as future events to come. Instead,  Rookie Cops  fixated upon character introductions, early dilemmas for the characters and potential setups,  before plunging into the deep-end with a pacy and angst-ridden second-half with varying results . The tonal shift did help to keep viewers intrigued and intensify the climatic events of the second-half. However, this also caused some drawbacks for  Rookie Cops also. Although some of the intriguing  counterplots  of the series such as the rocky friendship between Kim Tak and Seung-Hyun, Eun-Gangs gradual maturation as well as emotive themes such as anger, loss and love as well as focusing upon other subject areas such as  corruption, peer pressure and corporal punishment, there were several subplots which were admittedly poorly fleshed-out. For example, Seung-Hyuns estranged  relationship with his father  and the escapades of other side characters such as Shin Ah Ri were often disregarded during key moments. Through the directing lens of  Kim Byung Soo (  Queen In Hyuns Man,  A Korean Odyssey and  He Is Psychometric),  Rookie Cops is  a fairly slick and glossy production. Admittedly early episodes of the series seemed to place a heavy- budget emphasis upon frequent cut scenes of the academy;  with little variance in tone or schemes. However as the second-half dawned upon the series,  Rookie Cops  took a different  approach to filming  by helping to captivate through Byung Soos leadership, the emotional tones through  gradients  and palettes of the characters at  different times in the series  . ( In particular off-whites, golden hues and blues were frequently shown onscreen during key scenes and interactions.)The OST of  Rookie Cops is predominantly composed of a compilation   of schmaltzy ballads and pop tracks. Admittedly with some tracks more memorable than others,  LUCYs  contemplative and guitar pop track  Police Class from OST Part 2, TIME, an upbeat song  performed by singer  Kwon Eun Bi  from OST Part 4, as well as  Kang Daniels  adrenal-infused tempo song Hush Hush featured on  the Special OST were surprisingly ear-catching tracks . The finale of  Rookie Cops was admittedly dependent on expectations. Although there was a shocking  twist for the audience, the execution of the sudden plot-twist felt admittedly last minute; quickly thrown in to the storyline narrative in order to add edge and surprise , though failing to help impact the characters or the falling action. Lighthearted, angst-ridden and surprisingly profound at times,  Rookie Cops is a series which offered viewers with a lighthearted and sugary coming of age tale, as well as moody crime-drama in parts also. Nevertheless  despite some brilliant acting performances and an intriguing setup,  Rookie Cops did admittedly  suffer slightly under the weight of execution by underdeveloped subplots and several overindulgent tropes. However for those looking for the best of both worlds through both sweet and darker themes,  Rookie Cops is a fairly entertaining binge-watch also."

The protagonist is more concerned with her own peace of mind than primarily with new suffering that she in turn has to inflict on her perpetrator. She doesn't want to keep turning the wheel of fate, she wants to stop it.Yet once again, being stuck in the past is a driving force: in this case, the protagonist sits in prison awaiting execution - for decades. ----- SIDE NOTE: South Korea has in practice stopped using the death penalty, but all legislative initiatives to officially abolish the death penalty (most recently in 2019) have so far failed.Dramaturgic maneuver with magical components: a body swap. The motif is not new to KDrama. Although the personalities in the body are now different, the bodies themselves still have their cellular memories plus the environment inevitably remembers the person originally owning this body. So there is lots of room for funny situations - although they are always solved humorously, they are not slipping into farce. The story is serious and touching, but also playfully told. Laughter is allowed. A teardrop here and there, too.I consider the acting performance in ""Room No. 9"" as its true highlight: Kim Hee-sun and Kim Hae-sook manage brilliantly to unite the characteristic aura of the other and thus perfectly embody the switch.

Based upon the webtoon of the same-name, Rugal had all the good selling points of a thrilling drama-   macabre, original and intriguing plotline, unique characters, venerable actor Choi Jin- Hyuk taking the lead and of course fairly pioneering and new  film studio and Studio Dragon ( same makers as  critically- acclaimed dramas such as Children of a Lesser God , Love Alarm  and Doctor John) taking creative control of the show,  should  have easily sealed Rugals fate as one of the best Korean dramas of 2020. So naturally  this raises the dire  question we all want to know ;  So what  went wrong to make it so bad ?.Of course, normally ( regardless of whether I can access the webtoon or not), I like to try and be non-biased and take into account a  drama based on a webtoon ( regardless of whether Ive read it or not) as a standalone story  with its own characters, plot and original qualities as it should be assessed as a series in its own right  . On the other hand with comparing  images and forums  of  original pans from the webtoon ( which actually seems pretty good) and comments by fans  of the Korean version in contrast  to the actual dire deliverance of the drama, it is pretty fair to say that the drama writers made the classic mistake of  pacing. To put into refined words, pacing is a classic feature in stories into how quickly the story moves , however, in Korean dramas due to being in a televised or streamed format , it can quite literally make or break the audience and critical response from watchers. There isnt necessarily a correlation between  slow meaning  no viewers or  quick meaning  lots of viewers  because at the end of the day, the biggest part to play in any Korean drama is storywriting , however, pacing can affect the quality and  deliverance of the story for viewers.Rugals biggest problem, however,  isnt that the storyline isnt interesting ( quite the opposite in regards to a cop upon deaths door both literally and metaphorically blinded from the truth and being given a new opportunity to take his revenge) , but, there just isnt enough time for viewers to both catch-up or develop any interests within the storyline or characters. Jin- Hyuk cannot be faulted for what he was given to work with , however, his character may as well just have  moulded together with failed storyboards  and scripts for viewers as there quite simply wasnt enough exposure to his character, Ki- beom as an individual outside of the story. For most viewers to relate  to even the seeming villain of a story, writers often reflect qualities we can see in ourselves, friends and family in a character - traumatic pasts, complicated relationships with the people around us  or even just emotions - these are all real qualities most of us know in the real world. Whilst as viewers we do come to understand Ki- beoms anguish and fury  over his wife being taken from him, we dont really learn why this should be significant for us as viewers either through a sense of normality or love to hit closer to home, or, the actual  after affects of losing this normality for Ki-beom.  Even in minor scenes such as Ki-beom walking as a blind man or being able to see for the first time, a moment of weakness by stumbling or having to lie down wouldve allowed us to step back and see Ki-beom as someone who is a relatable hero. Instead the show is too focused on Ki-beom becoming an all-fighting machine to actually consider these fleshed-out moments. ( A classic case of the show doing this is within  his former police coworkers happily accepting that their close companion and a man they thought had either been dead or missing for the past several months, could just return all of a sudden without a second thought.) As you can imagine, whilst the quick pacing allows us to get to the quirky  action scenes, Rugal again simply  doesnt give us a chance to  know the other characters ;  Mi Na ( Jung Hye In), should have easily been one of the most profound considering her past yet was written-off to see her delivering punches throughout the series with her comrades or enemies and Lee Gwang Chul ( Park Sun Ho) had so much potential to be a genuinely enigmatic character, yet the drama wrote him off as a goof for the majority of the drama rather than an individual. Maybe on one note of praise the show did surprisingly deliver both a good performance by Han Ji Wan and surprisingly intriguing characterisation around one of the shows antagonists,  Choi Ye Won. Although  her character should have initially been despicable, her moral grey area around the intrigue of Beom and the horrific  actions  of the major antagonist Deok Goo ( Park Sung Woong) did add a level of intrigue around her character. Its just a shame that the writers couldnt have done the same for the previously mentioned antagonist, who although wanting to be portrayed in a villainous light, had no intriguing motives or features at all as a villain apart from just being a violent menace . Perhaps the scriptwriters were  becoming conscious of how much time theyd wasted seeing characters deck one another twelve times or how wed spent nearly six episodes watching the characters fight or train without Ki- Beom getting any closer to learning about his wife, as near the ending of the drama, we did see a couple of loose threads attempting to be tied. On the other hand, the problem with this decision lies with the returned problem of pacing. Seeing  nearly fifteen episodes of a  comedic character  such  as Gwang Chul suddenly struggling with an inner-battle with himself  does not add a level of depth or shock for viewers, it just adds another round of groans  and questions  due to having no indicators of Gwang Chul struggling in previous episodes.  This seems to point out that Rugals biggest failure is just not being able to keep up with the right speed of pacing with racing through the story and give us little time as viewers to grow used to the characters or story points. ( As an  example  of intriguing  story pacing consider probably one of the most sensational  Korean dramas of the 2010s, Sky Castle - the drama spiked from slow pacing to suddenly quick to back to slow in a matter of episodes yet love or loathe the drama, it was able to keep viewers entertained because viewers could adhere and keep-up with the story because of the pacing-style. Rugal couldve lived up beyond expectations if it had been given the right pacing, yet the show just fell into its own despair by trying to race to scenes of mindless violence and fighting instead   )."

Could romance be in the cards for these two couples?","Cha Hwa Yun, Choi Soo Young, Kang Tae Oh, Park Young Gyu, Shin Sae Kyeong, Shin Se Kyung, Yim Si Wan","jTBC, Netflix","A Cinematic Journey To Love...  When it comes to writing love stories, romance dramas often tend to blow out relationships heavily into cliche territory; the female or male lead is head over heels for their significant other, jealousy spins around their love interest approaching (respectfully) other men and women, and an onslaught of dramatic misunderstandings occur as a consequence.  When you  decide to sit   down and watch  Run-On for the first time,  it may strike viewers as unusual   to come across several  prominent, atypical  features within our leads and their relationships; the most evident being that our female heroine and translator Oh Mi Joo (Shin Se Kyung) and our male lead athlete  Ki Seon Geom ( Im Shi Wan) are intrinsically written as individuals, rather than the typical  unit approach taken in most romantic dramas. Shin Se Kyung is brilliant within her role  as our fairly down-to-earth female lead Oh Mi-Joo; a talented and hardworking  translator with  a difficult childhood , Mi-Joo alongside her best friend Park Mae Yi  (  Lee Bong Ryun) , is more focused on her career and struggling to pay the bills than anything else.Contrastingly, Ki Seon Geom ( again, brilliantly played by Im Shi Wan) comes from a wealthy family, has a successful career as an athlete, however, he  is quite simply  fed up from others using him, his money and status as a social climbing ladder as episodes progress. By a whim of fate, the two individuals from opposite walks of life   end up meeting and gradually developing a relationship. However, this is also where the series hits its biggest snag as well.The  opposites attract cliche is one of the most infamous storyline usages in romantic dramas, yet when it came to Run-On, one of the notable elements of a storyline intrinsically based on this cliche seemed to feel unexpectedly  lacklustre. By default, it shouldnt  have done; Mi-Joo  and Seon- Geom were well-rounded individuals with  intriguing backstories , storylines and striking similarities as characters, yet, principally rather than playing  out their similarities, the show seemed to ride too heavily upon their differences which often resulted in their relationship feelings fairly indifferent for viewers .One reason behind this can be explained by Mi-Jo and Seo Geoms relationship progression over the course of the series.  Despite their differences, Mi-Joo had many similar impacts of her past  like Seon-Geom,  however,  neither character really tried to reach  out, to talk or bond over this matter either.This should have helped to bring our couple together more throughout the drama, however, this would have only been possible if the storyline had more of an arching development for our characters,  (due to  little sense of climatic building),strong pacing or intrinsic development over a course of sixteen episodes. Alongside our main couple, the drama attempts also to introduce the romantic pairing between slightly naive art  student Lee Young Hwa ( Kang Tae Oh) and  the cynical young CEO of a talent agency company, Seo Dan Ah (  Choi Soo Young). Before commenting upon their relationship, it is fairly striking that Dan Ah  has numerous  deep and likeable qualities as a character ( despite  her sometimes  overly abrupt personality); she isnt written off as  a figure of female animosity nor as the  antagonist, but rather an individual hiding deep secrets, a naturally hardworking businesswoman and who is the type that struggles to reach  out to  others both emotionally and socially  ( often leading to both comical and sad misunderstandings). Against all odds,  the relationship between the pair was arguably more appealing to audiences than our main couple at times. This is intrinsically due to the fact that Young Hwa and Dan Ah are truly the epitome of different within their backgrounds, moralities and even personality types, yet are still able to develop and bond due to  their similarities( particularly their admiration of art). On the other hand, their relationship will still notably lacking in depth; a consequence of several plot inconsistencies, tropes  as well as the series possibly  running out of time to not truly captivate  life imitating art to the fullest. Overall whilst Run-On was an intrinsically sweet romance drama which had  several surprisingly well-written characters, an appropriate ending , humour and touched upon several notable realistic issues including  homosexuality, illness, mental health and  family, notable relationship portrayals ,  development , plot holes and of course an overall  didactic  purpose  for the show, felt both lacklustre and lacking in the grand scheme of things."

Insights into the early 16th century art included  ""Saimdang, Memoir of Colors"" is an excellent KDrama with historically impressive dimensions. The focus here is on the legendary artist Shin Saimdang, whose head is also depicted on the 50,000 won note today.  The KDrama pays tribute to the great artist and also pays tribute to her roles as a devoted mother and virtuous, yet uncompromisingly progressive woman. The focus is on a time and space transcending, tragic love story - fictitious... or at least not historically documented. (But why shouldt it have happened in this way or another?  ... :-)----------------- SIDE NOTE ---  Shin Saimdang (1504 -1551) --- ... was a painter, calligrapher and poet who was valued in her time and far beyond. Since her father had no son, he gave her (rather unorthodox for a girl) an education and training in literature, poetry, calligraphy, embroidery and painting. Her works as a painter are characterized by their particularly sensitive view of nature and its subtle, sensitive representation. Today only about 40 paintings in Indian ink and mineral colors can be directly assigned to Saimdang. However, it is suspected that many more works of art have survived, although they are not clearly signed as her works. Shin Saimdang has also gone down in history as the ideal of the good mother. She had five sons and three daughters, some of whom also inherited their mother's talent. One of her sons is the even more famous Neo-Confucian scholar and politician Yul-gok Yi I. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------In addition, as far as the perspective of traditional art is concerned, the special focus of this KDrama is the nature of the world of animals, plants and mountains.  Actually, it could be mentioned here, that South Korea is characterized by several mountains and 21 national parks on more than two thirds of the country's surface. This KDrama aesthetically focuses on the spiritually legendary mountain region around the Geumgangsand - The Diamond Mountain. It probably got its name in connection with the Diamond Sutra of Buddhism. It was a center of Korean Buddhism, traces of which can be dated back to the 1st century. At the beginning of the 20th century there were still more than 40 active monasteries in the region. In any case, the mountain world plays in several respects an important role in this gripping historical drama.Special dynamics arise through the play with intertwining time and space. There are two plots. One is set in 2017, the other in the early 16th century during the Joseon era. One follows a young art historian writing her PhD thesis on artist An Gyeon's work 'Geumgangsando'. The other follows historical Shin Saimdang through the first 3-4 decades of her passionate yet virtuous life. Parallel to the art historian's research and struggle with it, that is at the same time enhanced and endangered by Saimdangs diary, insights on the artists eventful life are revealed. Both storylines are quite exciting in their own way. Particularly charming: people from Saimdang's time-line seem to have reincarnated in Seoul in 2016 and are once more somehow connected to each other... Surprisingly, the fulcrum where the timelines converge is Tuscany in Italy. This extraordinary and visually stunning KDrama offers a truly poetic, heart-rending story, added with interesting insights into the special aesthetics and sensitivity of contemporary Korean art of the early 16th century, as well as the paper production craftmanship of that time. It is rounded by an atmospheric soundtrack and, last but not least, actors who are as if absorbed in their roles. At last, there is plenty of makjang, too. Taking everything into account, the story is effortlessly captivating over 28 episodes. At the end I was left in bewilderment, yet to some extend somehow surprisingly satisfied, too."

Ive listed the potential triggers at the end of this review.Salon De Nabi aka Fly High Butterfly '' is an underrated drama that was not released in Korea due to the bullying scandal of supporting actress, Shim Eun Woon (Jen).  The drama was released in Taiwan instead and then on Amazon Prime in selected regions.  Its really unfortunate that Salon de Nabi did not get its deserved release and promotion because its a great drama.  It tackles many important social issues through the lives of the 7 individuals working at the salon and their customers.  Initially, I thought this would be a lighthearted watch, but I was wrong.  I did laugh a lot, but I also shed many tears for the characters.  I was shocked at how funny and depressing the first episode was.I realized that I had to pay attention to this drama as not all the events and explanations are openly and graphically shown.  There's quite a bit of subtlety to the storytelling, e.g. the uncle greeting the teenager and touching her arm, the character calling out their mothers name outside the police station and then the camera panning to the cross hanging in the car, which then reminded me the scene where the character left a cake outside their familys door.  These scenes are shown to us, but not explicitly explained.We get to know each of the 7 unique main characters in the salon, some with a bigger focus than others.  The drama uses a lot of humor when introducing them but along with the laughter, theres a lot of tears when we learn of the challenges each of them faces. I would not have liked this drama as much if there were only funny parts.  Gi Bbeum, as the female lead, has the most screen time and the biggest character development.  Her story was the first to be introduced in episode 1 and also sets the tone for the rest of the drama.  Its lovely to see how shes changed from an introverted, quiet but hard working intern who battles social anxiety, to a more confident and outspoken designer/hairdresser-in-the-making.  Despite her flaws, shes not afraid to keep learning and asking questions.  Her questions might be weird but shes trying very hard to improve.  Her romance with Moo Yeol is really cute.  Theyre destined to be together as Moo Yeol seems to be the only one that can understand her mumbling speech.  The love confession does seem to have come out of nowhere despite the weak explanation that she might have liked him from day 1.  I think Moo Yeol brings Gi Bbeum out of her shell and helps her become a better version of herself.  He is quite attuned to her moods, and is not afraid to ask her questions.  Gi Bbeum, though shy, is very honest with Moo Yeol.None of these characters are perfect, and a couple might be very annoying.  But these flawed characters feel relatable thus we care about them and root for them to overcome their challenges.  I particularly like the odd pair of Jen & Kwang Soo.  Jen is the best wingwoman and shes so badass.  Kwang Soo is the weirdest and most self-absorbed jerk, yet he can be very perceptive and can shut you down with his no nonsense facts.  I probably like Michelle and Soo Ri the least, and find them slightly annoying.  Poor Teacher Woo is just there.  He doesnt get a lot of screen time or lines, but I think thats because of who he is.  This weird bunch of individuals dont necessarily like each other and are not the found family in other dramas that give you the warm and fuzzy feeling.  But when one of them is in need, they rally behind and have each others back. There are a few circumstances where I dont agree with the initial reactions of the characters.  But when I think clearly, their reactions and actions are very normal. These are flawed characters and it takes time for them to digest the information, but will also act appropriately at the end.My main criticism is probably the number of issues they try to cover in this drama.  Sometimes, I feel like the drama is trying to do too much, therefore, a few of the storylines are fully developed. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this drama if you want a slice-of-life drama that covers some relatable issues in a very funny yet human way.Other Random Observations:1. Some bad wigs are used in this drama.2. Its funny how dissatisfied customers all run to the public restroom to check their hair.3. I have enough fat girls being criticized plot, forever stay in the friend zone and have low self-esteem.4. FLs fake smiles are haunting me.5. Its so sad that a character refused to go to the hospital after being stabbed by a pair of scissors.6. Jen & Kwang Soos romance could have developed more.7. Great advice from Jen about FLs first time having sex - looking back to see if its a fond memory.8. Love the interesting way of telling the origin story of the 7 individuals in episode 15.9. Ep 15 is technically the season finale.  Ep 16 is only a bonus episode.10. I did not like Ep 16 - its all fun but I was bored because I am missing the human element of the drama.  Comedy only is not enough for me.Potential Triggers (spoilers): bullying, weight issues, fat shaming, transphobia, sexual abuse, suicidal thoughts and attempts, depression, terminal illness.Completed: 3/19/2023"

I do not regret waiting so long, before picking it up again. I might have rated it lower if I was watching it as it was airing, being swayed by other people's opinions. Now, with a clear heart and head, I can be as true to myself as possible.STORYCults are not exactly the most commonly used theme for dramas, since it's hard to present them in a realistic way, staying true to the complexity of how these organizations work and the mentality of people being involved. This drama did a fairly good job at it. Till the end I wasn't 100%  sure if the cult leader is a true believer, or if its just an act. There were hints fitting both of the  cases throughout the show. That being said, it was unnecessary to introduce the ""corrupt politician"" into the mix. Next to such a fresh idea of the victims of a cult, giving us an overused story of a power hungry older guy doing anything he can to win, was a mistake. Especially since the drama would be just as interesting without it.CHARACTERSThe drama tries to sell us a story of 3 young heroes: Sang Mi, Dong Cheol and Sang Hwan. Sadly, they failed. They told us Sang Mi is the heart, Dong Cheol - the muscles and Sang Hwan the brain of the group, but it was Dong Cheol that came up with the majority of the plans, he was smart enough to know not to involve the cops and not to believe in Sang Hwan's dad. Sang Mi was smart enough to fool everyone involved in the cult and survived there for years. There was no brain in Sang Hwan up until ep 14/15th. A bit too late if you ask me. There was truly nothing going on for him as a character and I was never invested in him and his journey. He was there to show up at times and solve plot problems that might be hard to explain otherwise.As I was finishing the drama, I finally knew why I disliked Sang Hwan so much: the writer and director tried to TELL us he is the hero of the story next to Sang Mi, but they did not SHOW it at all. He kept making the same mistakes, never learning from any of them. All the consequences never hit him directly, but hurt the people around him. Don't know if it was the director's/writers idea or Taecyeon's misdelivery, but I never felt that he is truly sorry for all the things that he did. The production team tried to put him in the same ""I am a victim here"" group as Dong Cheol and Sang Mi, which was ridiculous. His mistake put his best friend in jail and an innocent girl in a cult for years, and everyone forgave him like it was not a big deal. I don't believe that there can be a nonredeemable character and they could have made Sang Hwan work, but they did not even try. All the mistakes were just forgotten.One of the more interesting characters to watch was Apostle Kang. There were moments when we could slowly see her breaking out of that ""salvation"" mindset and seeing how things truly are in Goosuwon. It made me question and wonder how her character will develop and which side she will be standing on at the end. I appreciate that she stayed true to her beliefs, no matter how twisted they were. It just shows the true power of manipulation and brainwashing that had happened in the cult.ACTINGExcept for Taecyeon, all the cast did an amazing job. I must say, I might be biased though. I never liked Taecyeon acting, not once have I thought he did a good job with the role given. I just don't feel any deep emotions and those nuances in his facial expressions that distinguish amazing actors from just an actor. Being placed between such a strong cast, I could see that he still lacks in some areas of the delivery.On the bright side though, Jung Hae Kyun and Yoon Yoo Sun did a fantastic job, easily overshadowing the rest of the cast with their acting. Everyone truly hated Joo Ho and felt pity towards Bo Eun. Many people think acting ""crazy"" is an easy thing to do since you just have to do random stuff, but it's hard... really hard to make it believable. The random stuff are not really random, there is a reasons they do them, do stuff that no one else seems to understand. You need to understand the reasoning behind the unreasonable actions to be able to portray them in your character.Overall, really good drama. The frustration that keeps rising during the watch makes the ending even better. Even the comical death of Jung Ki was a good choice, and if all the actions leading to it were not as serious and heavy, I might say they overkill him.

Even the town's much-revered Reverend Sung, a young and good-looking minister who seemingly has the ability to heal the sick, approves of Choi's plans.Behind his guise of devotion, however, Choi is a practiced con man posing as a representative of a fake religion; his true aim is to defraud the villagers of their resettlement compensation.

Its portrayal of a cult lacked a compelling thematic foundation, opting instead to draw inspiration from cheap rip-off D-grade movies themed around cults. Where cults are extremely over-dramatized to the point of crossing the supernatural territory. The cult apparently possessed super powers of hypnosis with only a few words spoken, even towards people who weren't perceptible to religious and spiritual beliefs. Everything surrounded the cult came off as cartoonish even within the context of a 'drama'. The narrative itself struggled to carry its own weight, particularly as it primarily focused on the perspectives of the outsiders. It always felt as if it was building up towards something bigger but it never got there. For a 16-episodes run, it needed a proper world building and foundation for the cult. Establishing a distinct ""character"" for the cult would have provided a stronger identity. Back to the outsiders, having the drama led by teenage characters was another weak aspect of it. Bland and cardboard characters. The mystery element was a crucial part of the drama yet it was lacking and under-delivering. The first season would have fared better as a standalone one-off movie rather than a drama. It doesn't make any sense why the drama was rated this high, according to MDL standards, especially when season 2 effectively addressed most of the issues with the cult and delivered an overall better package!Regarding Season 2:It managed to deliver a much more compelling package than season 1. The most important part is that it handled the cult theme properly. The characters and the cast were a lot more appealing than season 1. Having a more adult leading characters rather than teenager was a plus. Uhm Tae Goo was a perfect casting choice for his character. The story had a better and more natural progression than season 1. However, it got sloppier the closer it got to the ending. Speaking of the ending, it was a bit underwhelming and not as grandiose as I hoped it would be. Second season should have been a stand alone drama unrelated to the first one, not even in the name. If you don't feel like watching two seasons then you can ignore the first one and just watch the second."

After several delays and problems occurred before the official release, I really waited for so long just to watch this one since I am a big fan of KBS school series. I have a love-and-hate feedback about the show since it was different from the previous shows but also the reason why the show doesnt have a definite impact on me.The first half of School 2021 was really a great one but they failed to be consistent on maintaining the satisfying ambiance of watching the show after the last few episodes. From unexpected plot twists from the beginning to the typical classic plot in the ending, the downfall. Also, the story of the side couple overshadowed the story of the main couple. They dont even have the proper chemistry needed in the story. I cant feel anything except seeing two actors trying their best to create chemistry but failed to do so. I am really happy to see Yohans acting skill improved during this show but I cant feel that he is the main character. Kang Se Yeons character was more likely deserving to be the main character compared to the others.On the other hand, Kang Min playing the role of Ho Sung was really cringe. His character here is the most annoying one in terms of acting. I just feel that it doesnt fit him. The same with his on-screen couple Eun Bi. The way she smiles was really awkward most of the time. I was really looking forward to her role since she has the same name from my favorite school series in 2015, yet her acting doesnt give justice to her role.The thing I hate the most is that the story revolves around the world of adults. It was a never-ending struggle of students facing their life involving the adults as the villain. Yes, it happens in real life but I am expecting more youthful struggles involving the interpersonal and intrapersonal relationship of the students.Anyways, it was good enough for a School series but I expected more than from what they gave me. Some student characters have interesting stories but they tend to focus more on the issue of the annoying adults trying to ruin the life of the students for their selfish reasons. The OST Dream On contributes additional points in my score review since I really like the song."

This show definitely showed me that you can have a truly engaging drama without the episodes going on an on.  This is only 10 episodes, each about 25 minutes long.  So, it's kind of got that webtoon feel.  Kim Eun Sook is the producer and she's got serious writing credits to her name - Goblin, Descendants of the Sun, Secret Garden, Mr. Sunshine, The Heirs, King: The Eternal Monarch.  This show definitely has the Goblin feel to it, and I'm not complaining.The story has been told before.  A god of destiny has written the female lead's destiny, wanting to make it a masterpiece.  Once he gets to know her, he realized that the destiny he envisioned for her was all wrong.  Personal involvement for a god of destiny is a no-no, you get eliminated and go into the ether somewhere.  I love how the writers slowly revealed her past history with said god of destiny.  The longer I watched it, the more I felt ""If you're meant to be, you'll end up meeting in one way or another"" (great line, by the way).  Their lives were intertwined, and it was so interesting for us as viewers to discover that, and when the female lead makes that discovery, it's an ""aha"" moment, yet heartbreaking at the same time.In this show, the K-drama cliches really worked - fate, coffee (do Koreans really love their coffee as much as it is portrayed in dramas?), rain, umbrellas, first snow.I felt that the acting was very good.  Our clues to the passage of time seemed to be driven by the hairstyle of the lead.  Curly hair, straight hair.  The chemistry between the leads was very good, as was the bromance between the two main gods of destiny.  The lead actor's attractiveness, for me, grew as the show developed.  His development of emotions was very understated and real and were always held in check, often revealed by only a small smile.I loved the soundtrack.  A lot of it was very haunting and went perfectly with the scenes.  I especially liked the song Time Machine by Jeong Sewoon - he has the perfect voice for the vibe they were going for.Special effects.  Amazing!  The effects they used for eliminating a god were surreal and wispy.  When they went into the penthouse/book room, those effects were so good, the changing colors, the darkness, the mystery.I had to lower my rating one point because of the ending.  It was a little to ambiguous for me.  It went in line with the rest of the show, but it just wasn't satisfying for me.  Was he just going to keep being eliminated over and over?  And what happened to the rule of it only happening three times?  In my head I've written my own ending and  guess I'll have to be happy with that.  This show has definite re-watch value for me, though.  The writing was very clever and there was more humor than I expected.I'm so glad I watched this show!!"

Its truly not the top notch writing and the characters are quite frankly dumb. But the show has a weird excitement to it, I could not resist. It might be the result of a quite well balanced mix of genres: politics, military, mystery and corruption with action sequences on top.So how were the plot and characters? The whole team is full of silly little potatoes. The decision making would probably be better and more logical if they flipped a coin. They were all supposed to be professionals and specialists in their fields, or at least close to being them. How could Son Ye Rim just walk around like its not a big deal after being exposed to an unknown substance? How come in such a small team so many people have ulterior motives that can at times endanger other team members? How come they truly do not care about any military regulations 90% of the time? I think them being such idiots added to the entertainment value. Who doesnt like watching people make stupid decisions?That said, even though the dumbassness was frustrating, I enjoyed the characters themselves. The dynamics were fun to watch and slowly discovering any potential connections kept me more focused on what is going on on the screen.I appreciated how they didnt dump a massive exposition in episode one explaining all the details, but they also didnt leave me in the dark till the last moment. Clues, hints and puzzle pieces have been dropped throughout the show, slowly forming a whole picture. In the process I flipped from loving to hating to loving again many characters.Lets talk about CGI. Thank god the crazy dogs only happened at the beginning, because they were laughably bad. I always believed that sometimes not showing the monster is better than showing it with the use of shitty CGI. People are creative, they will fill the gaps.The pacing was well done, I didn't really feel bored during any episode. Keeping them an hour long (compared to the 1 h 30 min. we get lately) and only 10 episodes was a wise choice. This plot is definitely not something that could have been successfully stretched to 16 episodes. The biggest flop was episode 3, which for some strange reason, did not follow linear storytelling, and we jumped around the timeline like crazy. This made little sense.Overall, its not a smart show. I have no military knowledge, but some of the decisions that have been made were simply illogical, even for me. And yet, I liked it. For some strange reason. It was probably because of the characters and the cast. I wasnt that interested in Dong Jin and Ye Rim, but all the rest truly caught my attention. A girl needs to appreciate the real stakes too, even though it was painful to watch and it broke my heart a few times.Also, mad respect for including pictures of dogs with other actors in the end credits of the last episode.

I was a bit hesitant to start it as I mostly avoid high school dramas. The premise however led me to believe that this one might be different. Of course it still had the typical hs stuff but at the core of the story is a woman whose grief has consumed her and put her life on pause because of it. What I really liked about the show is how it went to the past for flashbacks and back to the future. That way it was easier to see how previous words and actions affected the lives of the characters involved. I knew Hamin was gonna die but I got the cause of his death spoiled for me online. I don't think that impacted the story for me as I still felt strong emotions.Kim Mingyu and Kang Hyewon were ok. It was clear they were just there for visuals but Hyewon was rather decent and natural for the role she was in. Mingyu widened his eyes too much and often came off stiff. He has room to improve though. I've heard some people criticize the kind of relationship he had with So Mang and how their ""closeness"" was a little inappropriate. I somewhat agree as there were times when their grief caused that line between teacher and student. The excessive touching and intimate moments between them were understandable but So Mang is still in a position over Jaemin and should act accordingly. I really liked Hamin's character.  I think the events leading up to his demise could've been tweaked for more emotional impact, especially the argument scene between him and So Mang. That part kind of made his decision look petty when in reality his situation was much more complex than that conversation. At least from the perspective of the drama, it was unclear as to what exactly pushed Ha Min to that point of no return. Maybe the webtoon is more focused. Ju Yeon brought the emotion and tenderness that was needed for this role and she got me teary-eyed at times because of her performance. My only other complaint with her character is the fact that she didn't read that last letter Ha Min had for her. It would've been painful, but it felt right for her to have unpacked the contents and accepted whatever last words Ha Min left behind. It was interesting for me to see how the characters dealt with loss differently. Ha Min's parents seemed to avoid the topic all together whereas So Mang constantly lived within the days leading up to the tragedy. I think the ending is relevant to real life when So Mang is forced to really move on and let go of what once was with Ha Min and begin living her life in a way that would make him smile. Even upon going back to her old school she was still living in the past and refused to move forward. Doing right by Jaemin on behalf of Ha Min was a part of the grief process and that in itself was nice to watch.Overall I liked this one. Def gonna check out the webtoon now :)"

Watch this drama.From nonsense plots, countless slaps to antagonists clawing their way out of their wicked plans, this drama has it all to make you feel so angry. When you think the FL is getting some progression towards her revenge, guess what? Nope! The antagonists get back on track, commit miserable things again and crimes without getting caught or punished by the law. The FL doesnt seem to have the will to manage that deep anger she feels for being wrongfully accused of horrible things she supposedly did. She lacks action and passively puts up with the situation. Shes been deceived, cheated on, deprived of many things, they made her believe horrendous lies, she has suffered a lot so in the beginning you think once she gathers herself together, her emotions and gets out of prison, she will be unstoppable. Yes, there will be moments where not everything will go as planned but for sure, karma is going to taste like heaven. Its going to be epic! And   The more you continue watching, the more you find yourself asking, what in the tangerines is going on? How can a storyline be so low quality and so messed up? They keep adding up more and more drama, to the point its getting ridiculous! The drama they are adding is so absurd. Most of the characters, if not all, are annoying or have their annoying moments where you just dont understand their behavior. Its okay to be annoying, but these characters have another level of annoyance. I find it so hard to sympathize with them. Its definitely a case of a kdrama where the producers openly decided to not care about the storyline making it credible but milk the **** out of it. Also, why is it called Second Husband? I dont understand at all where this drama is heading to. Thats why I dropped it. Huge disappointment, doesnt deserve 7.6. Also wanted to point out something, whats with Koreans and the slapping? The amount of slaps in this kdrama is unbelievable. They slap each other as if it was something normal. Hey *slap*, What are you doing? *slap*, *breathes* *slap*.. Story: dont expect to be wowed. Its getting dragged and the story is full of nonsense. The Sharon episodes got me rolling my eyes so hard they reached my brain. It felt like the producers were making fun of the viewers. How can they not recognize Seon Hwa aka Sharon. Let me disappear for a bit and then come back to my family, friends and ennemis and call myself Susan. New hairstyle, new clothes, new way of speaking.. nobodys gonna know.. LMAO.  0 credibility.Music: inexistant. Barley remember being pleasantly surprised. Actors: disappointing acting. Seems like they just debuted acting. However, Seon Hwa and Hae-Ran are the only ones that made me continue watching this drama. Both of them carried it on their backs. They know how to convey emotions and honestly I think they deserve to act in a kdrama that has the potential to hit a huge success with a storyline that truly makes their acting shine even more. The cast is lacking a lot of experience in my opinion. Overall: the starting of the drama was so promising then it just got dragged. 120 episodes out of 150 and we viewers arent satisfied at all. Theres no light at the end of tunnel, no moments where the FL really stands up and starts doing the right things to get her revenge. She tries, yes. Some moments where you think she finally got that until she gets screwed up again by the antagonists. Not satisfactory at all. No matter how they will end this kdrama, I can already predict the FL will still struggle until the very end and the last episode will show how she finally got her revenge. A revenge that was overdue, unimpressive and unemotional . This kdrama made the antagonists shine more than the FL. The producers didn't seem to want to make this drama a success, in my opinion, it was just a question of getting that paycheck (they extended the drama by 30 episodes btw, so it says it all..). Conclusion: Second Husband is a waste of time, there are many kdramas worth our precious time. You can watch it but something tells me you will drop it ASAP and if its not the case, then respect!"
Second to Last Love,,,5993,2016.0,2016.0,20,,,,"An adult romance about a forty-something woman finding love and who works as a television producer. She has no interest in romance and just concerns herself with preparing for retirement, but when she moves to a new town, she meets a 46-year-old man who’s widowed and has one child, and a romance begins.","Ji Jin Hee, Kim Hee Ae, Kim Seul Gi, Kwak Shi Yang, Lee Soo Min, Stephanie Lee",SBS,"Mature romance, yet balanced with the eternal youth residing in the feeling of falling in love.  ""Second to Last Love"" is processing the topic 'getting old in South Korea' in a playful, sometimes profound, sometimes tender way. 'Old' means having exceeded 40. An 'Ahjumma' can be a swear word for a South Korean woman. Also Ahjussi for a man. In German it would probably be comparable if the casual 'Du' among around +/- 30 year old people suddenly became a 'Sie' - then you know: now I've fallen out of the '+/- same age'...In South Korea, a large percentage of life revolves around looking good and looking young. Marriage is also a big topic -  wedding photos are always placed accordingly large and dominant in the house or apartment. The family ultimately forms the meaning of life, so to speak, if you follow in the footsteps of tradition.  In case you stick to this standard - look good, marry well and take care of an honorable family - then everything is fine. Just one step to the right or left of the path creates social turbulence. Women (and men too) must be prepared and able to stand this. The issue will come up more or less confrontationally on every occasion.This South Korean peculiarity is the starting point for many a KDrama. In ""Second to Last Love"" as well. However, this story chooses its own fine style and an almost progressive approach to it. Age and age differences in partnership are brought up again and again in several respects. Likewise, married vs. unmarried. Not only the conservative, but also somewhat more free-spirited perspectives and opinions are interspersed in a refreshingly good mood.While the female protagonist is a career woman and single, the male protagonist lives as the head of a patchwork family. His wife died long ago, as did her fianc. (Not that they didn't want a partner...) They've both been living their particular single life-style for decades by now and have gotten used to it. They no longer expect anything to change. This is where the KDrama comes in and tweaks a few dramaturgical adjustments in order to shake them both up and question their lives, their life plans, their longings and decisions. They may be 'old' in the eyes of society, but their lives are far from over. And THAT is the key point! There is still time and space for new decisions, for change, even for a second love in the last half of their life. Apart from aging, ""Second to Last Love"" is also about taking responsibility for one's own life and one's own decisions, including new ones. Despite all the depth, which it doesn't shy away from, the KDrama also has a touch of humor overall.The protagonists 'grown-up' relationship is so delightfully mature and refreshingly grounded. Kim Hee-ae and Ji Jin-hee embody this adult maturity successfully balanced with the magic of eternal youth that resides in the feeling of falling in love. Their rapprochement, their feelings for each other and their attitude towards the other form a pleasant contrast to the more enthusiastic youthful forms that the protagonists are also confronted with...The story is embedded in a picturesque, idyllic landscape and also allows a look behind the curtains of KDrama industry. The plot and its difficult issues - 'aging' and 'taking responsibility' - are rounded off by a few secondary plots within the patchwork family and work colleagues. A bit of intrigue should not be missing either. Last but not least, and above all, there is the romance, which despite the obstacle-filled terrain unerringly and sensitively paves the way between the two protagonists..."

With what her boutique secretly offer she has made herself irreplaceable for the established upper circles of society . - An eye-catcher: Kim Sun-a as Jenny Jang in always exquisite, stylish fashion and with sunglasses that are extravagant in every lighting condition. She acts mostly calm, controlled, superior, with a poker face and in every situation a suitable solution to the problem. - A joy: Go Min-si as an intelligent Baduk (Go) player and equal strategist who suddenly stumbles into Jenny Jang's team. - A ray of hope: The fact that this KDrama lives on the many powerful female leads. Three Jaebeol ladies (!) included. The 'men' here tend to be tame shepherd dogs in the service of 'their' ladies...I was immediately enthusiastic about ""Secret Boutique"". The KDrama is exciting. Intelligent. Complex. Stylish in the high-end segment. Often almost cinematic in light, colors, camera and set design. And despite all the sublime arrogance, sophistication and need for (self)control, it is also touching. Human traits are presented not only abysmal. A warming grounding in cordiality comes along with the characters around the Go player Lee Hyeon-ji. Calling the story of ""Secret Boutique"" a romance wouldn't be appropriate. Feelings still play an important role - here and there and over there, too. Deep feelings no less. Nothing is shallow here. But primarily I would describe the KDrama as the exciting story of a revenge campaign. A story about the (emotional) price of such a vendetta. In addition, an intriguing story about the unfair, corrupt and criminal machinations of the greedy rich, who unscrupulously go over dead bodies, too. A compassionate story that offers insight into the very particular structure of the Jaebeol empires, which channel their power within the family (at the expense of trust, warmth and closeness). A touching story about love and loyalty. Also about how roles, norms and social structures as well as an ambitious ego hurt your own heart. In addition, the KDrama came up with a profound punchline that takes the Jaebeol worldview to the point of absurdity: the Jaebeol daughters, who are so convinced of their elitist, inherited noblesse and who consider themselves so much more valuable due to their lineage, actually do not have any Jaebeol-blood at all ...

It did not drag what so ever. I know in some mystery dramas the story ends up being craggy and people start to lose interest but in this drama it doesn't. The directed and the writer does not go overboard with it. It was fast paced too, I didn't feel like the drama was fast towards the end I felt it went at the right place which was good because most dramas finishes the drama with a fast pace. The storyline itself it nice and I also liked the side stories they were fun. As the main plot of the drama is kind of heavy the side stories makes you appeal more to it which is weird that I don't know how to even explain. I would date the storyline: 9.0Acting: Needless to say the acting was on point. Everyone did well the main cast, supporting cast etc. I really loved Song YoonAh. She's really amazing and I love her works. It was my first time seeing Kim So Yeon and she did an excellent job made her character live.  Those two were the highlights but of course song Jae Rim and Kim Tae Woo did well to. Song Jae Rim is just so cute, really loved him in here and Kim Tae Woo did a good job as the villain in the story. I really hated him which means he did a good job. Wish to see them all in newer projects in the future. Acting was;10/10I don't think there was anything I disliked apart from the title because once you watch it you will start to think about the title like ""who is the secret mother"" ""what does the title mean by secret mother"" it could have been titled with something better that suits the show more such as ""mothers secrets"" in which if you had watched the drama then you would understand what that would have meant. This drama is underrated and it shouldn't have been. You would definitely enjoy this drama if you give your full attention/concentration.

The first case the Royal Inspector and his team take sets the foundation of their friendship and their dynamics as a team while presenting to the viewer what is yet to come. And yet, the story is pretty generic after that, with a bad guy who was neither intriguing nor original. The romance was also a bit of a let down, as it had a messy pace, but, at least, it didn't overtake the story and played the role of filling the gaps. Unfortunately, the side romance and the trop of past love interest coming back to create drama was well used, probably a bit too much at times.

I started watching this show quite by accident and it was an ""interesting"" experience. ;)Surprisingly, the Shows timeline was not the usual sometime during Joseon but is pinpointed quite precisely. It was set several years after the end of the Qing Korean War which is dated to1636. However, a good deal of the show is subversive of the ideals of the day and this is not your typical sageuk. The cornerstone of the show is the character played by the FL. She may be small in stature, but she gives off a big aura with her personality and attitude, she is definitely a force to be reckon with. To compliment her is a noble scholar that is about as righteous as you can get but he is not cold and heartless. In fact, his heart was quickly captured by the unique qualities of the FL. Im quite happy with this pairing, not only because of their nice chemistry but also it allows them to be partners and not just the usual ditzy FL clinging onto the strong arm of the ML. The intelligence of the FL does come to the fore and gives the ML a run for his money. In fact, this show is quite female centric with strong female characters forming the nucleus of several subplots.In terms of acting, it is good from most quarters. Some roles are a bit over-the-top, but the actors put in the efforts, and it shows. Im particularly pleased with Kim Hye Yoon. She is a dynamo with an infectious smile. It was also good to see Ok Taec Yeon in a nice, good guy role where he can do some comedy as well as playing it straight. One surprise is the illegitimate son of the main antagonist. This character seemed straightforward at the beginning but grew more complex as the show progressed. Lee Jae Kyoon portraited him well and gave the character depth. Now we must address the elephant in the room, historical accuracy. If you are a sageuk aficionado, then give this show a miss. This show is all over the place when it comes to history and its interpretations. The core premise might be based on an actual historical event, but the Show just ran hard and fast with a lot of plot ideas, and it can border on irreverent at times.Another issue is the tone of the show. It really can turn on a dime. One minute we are watching slapstick comedy and then without much preamble we are in the midst of tortures and murders. It can be disconcerting when you are not really sure if the Show wants to be a light-hearted romcom or a serious drama. There is also more than a passing nod to spaghetti western movies with both its OST and some set pieces. I dare say to really enjoy this show you must firmly affix the rose-coloured glasses and stop worrying about plot holes and questionable storylines. Yes, it is a hot mess of storytelling at times but you cannot deny that it is also swoon-y, cheeky and entertaining so caveat emptor."

This drama stands out as the most beautiful and captivating production of the year, boasting top notch cinematography, mesmerizing OSTs, and exceptional performances from the cast.Rather than being a direct adaptation of the Manhwa, the concept is taken from a webtoon, and the writers created their own world with beautiful characters. Although there were several changes from the webtoon, I found myself genuinely liking the drama, which left me spellbound. The storyline revolves around a female protagonist who recalls her past 18 lives, embarking on a journey to fulfill an unfinished love from her 18th life while uncovering intriguing mysteries.One of the drama's standout elements is the portrayal of an unconventional relationship, where the female lead exudes strength while the male lead grapples with post traumatic issues. Their dynamic is refreshing as she takes the lead and he follows, creating a unique and endearing relationship.The ending of the drama was satisfying, with the female protagonist starting afresh by forgetting all her past memories, putting an end to a 19-life-long curse. The relationship between the female lead Ban Jieum and her 60+ year old niece Aegyeong from her 17th life was heartwarming to watch.Among the many memorable scenes, the bridge scene in the 9th episode stood out for its creativity. It beautifully depicted all of Banjieum's past lives walking behind her, symbolizing the interconnectedness of her experiences across time.Shin Hye Sun's portrayal of Ban Jieum was nothing short of phenomenal, impeccably capturing the emotional depth, strength, and love for her closed ones from past lives. Equally, Ahn Boh Hyun's casting as Seo Ha initially raised doubts, but he skillfully displayed Seo Ha's vulnerabilities and romantic side, proving himself to be an excellent fit for the role.The chemistry between the main leads was undeniable, making them my favorite on screen pair from 2023. While the second leads had limited screen time, they also did well, with Ha Yoon Kyung shining in the role of Cho Won.A character that left lasting impression was Mingi, whose mysterious aura captivated the audience from the beginning until the end. Lee Chae Min's portrayal was stellar, much like his performance in his previous drama CCIR.The chemistry between the actress playing Aegyeong and Shin Hye Sun was palpable, just as evident as their on screen chemistry in their previous drama, Mr. Queen.The drama was masterfully filled with numerous plot twists, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish. The character portrayal was praiseworthy, as none of the villains were entirely negative; instead, they were complex and shaded with grey, making them more realistic and intriguing.The cinematography of the drama was simply breathtaking, elevating every scene to an awe inspiring level. Notably, Episode 9 stood out for its exceptional cinematography, making it an unforgettable visual experience. The OSTs were perfect additions to the narrative. ""Juicy Juicy"" by Jo Yuri and ""Star"" by Colde has to be my most favourite OSTs of 2023. However, BGM department could have been better as some scenes didn't align well with the background music.In conclusion this drama is an absolute masterpiece, with brilliant performances and flawless execution. Fantasy lovers should not miss out on this mesmerizing series."

Well, its important to be honest by saying that like most  dramas out there, it  does have its ups and downs. However,  Sell Your Haunted House  has a beguiling charm due to its  cast, storyline and themes. As a character, Ji Ah could have easily become irksome for viewers as the archetypical    angst-ridden orphan female lead adorned in black, but, actress Jang Na Ra  undeniably brought a dynamic  ambience around her role as our  mysterious psychic. (Which is hard to imagine any other actress being able to  imitate.) This is shown case and point during one of the most emotional scenes of the series when, the emotionally conflicted Ji Ah, comes face to face with  her mother  Hong Mi Jin (Baek Eun Hye). The battle of tears behind Jang Na Ras eyes became one of the most beautifully  emotional and poignant moments of acting throughout the entirety of the drama.Although , its important not to turn a blind eye towards some of the shows downfalls either;not least with Jung Young Hwas performance as  In Beom.  This is not to spark hatred towards the actor as he is undeniably really good. ( As shown in previous roles such as  The Three Musketeers.)However , Jung Young Hwas performance honestly  lacked zest  at the best of times- sadly not helping  to  truly authenticate his character via performance alone .Every cloud has a silver lining and this certainly became prominent  by the character development of Young Hwas onscreen persona In Beom.  Whilst In Beoms  introduction  did seem to establish initial warning bells that he could go down the road as the tiresome "" comic relief"" , however, the male lead was offered the chance to escape this trope by using screentime to explore his conflicted emotions ( especially over his "" gift"") and his ambivalent morality surrounding later events of the series . This did not seal In Beom as being heinous"" or ""bad""; he is a kind-hearted person, just refreshingly not a ""flawless hero"" or the "" perfect love interest"" either. On this front, it is important to admit that tastes may vary upon the "" romance"" between our leads; for the most part, it is incredibly platonic. Without spoilers, the link between our leads is similar to being "" soulmates"", rather than having a passionately romantic  undertone  . Admittedly whilst this did serve a refreshing break from the cliche-ridden romanticised relationships of dramas, tastes will evidently vary for viewers. ( Therefore if youre expecting a particularly passionate romance in this supernatural drama , then "" Sell Your Haunted House"" isnt for you.)Even our side characters grew  in different ways. Joo Hwa Jung ( Kang Mal Geum) seems to start off the series as Ji Ahs pompous and self-righteous assistant, however, the series helped  to explore her complicated  backstory and bond with Ji Ah . Heo Ji Cheol ( Kang Hong Suk)- the self-proposed  Chief- and one of In Beoms closest friends Kim Tae Jin ( Heo Dong Won),  seemed  to be established as the "" comic dead weights"" in the series, however, they did provide themselves to be more than cliches with their actions during  moments of tension . However, it was equally entertaining to spend time with our cynical detective Kang Han Suk ( Kim Sung Bum) gradually developing credulity and respect for our psychic Ji Ahs help during crimes. To top it all off, Kim Mi Kyungs guest appearance in episode 13 ( as the Blue Salt Owner/exorcism supply craftswoman) was short, but, her added charm and sassy tone during line deliverances helped to establish an unusually respectful relationship between Ji Ah and the craftswoman.  Yet whilst ""Sell Your Haunted House"" had some formidable tour de force moments and characterisation , it did seem to struggle with establishing a more profound antagonist. Now, arguably ( without spoilers), there are two major antagonists here, however, the one which should be mentioned is certainly  Do Hak Sung ( Ahn Kil Kang). Lets be honest. Yes, he did serve his purpose as the "" driving force"" of events  in the series. But , for our trio of screenwriters ( Ha Soo Jin, Jung Yeon Seo and Lee Young Hwa) to have otherwise created  profoundly-developed characters , Hak Sung was the ultimate anomaly by fitting the trope as the ""moustache twirling villain"" of the series. On the other hand, the one thing which  Sell Your Haunted House truly authenticated was tackling difficult subjects as a  social criticism of the South-Korean housing system through the differing backstories of the dead.From a vengeful spirit  yearning for unearned incomes, property evictees and more , "" Sell Your Haunted House"" builds onto a  fresh premise with a mixture of horror, supernatural and thriller genres. The ending was fairly appropriate for the genre. Its  easy for some viewers to feel a little underwhelmed by the anticlimactic battle, however, the series did use time in between to wrap off storylines and permit  an appropriate farewell to our main characters.So, is it worth watching? In between a spine-tingling OST and a generic villain,"" Sell Your Haunted House"" offers an oddly dynamic  take on the supernatural genre. It isnt without its faults or flaws, but, its  intriguing characters and a fairly stellar cast easily establish it as one of the few good  dramas to have come out of   2021, so far..."

Fun, entertaining, sometimes clever elements, with a crappy core.Whats good? What are the reasons I somehow finished watching it? Everything except for the love story of Han Byul and Tae Sung, and both plot lines surrounding male lead. None of these 3 things work well - poorly written, with ridiculous resolution and out of the blue miracle ways out of the problems. The convoluted way they tried to tell us the story of Han Byul and Tae Sung was some next level of bad presentation. Rom-coms are not thrillers, you do not need 10 different plot twists to make it exciting. The worst part of it was the fact, this type of non-linear storytelling made it close to impossible to understand the characters at the beginning, which led to me simply not caring about them at all. The three semi-mystery plot lines, with two being part of a larger picture? Extremely unnecessary. The setting was all that needed to happen for the show to be interesting. Everyone wants to know what the behind the scenes looks like. What type of problems the actors face. How much of that glamorous life is try? What about the ugly side? The mundane celebrities life is interesting enough, no need to add over the top plotlines. Not to mention, they were simply not well integrated in the story. Instead of showing bits and pieces of it throughout the show, they dropped larger portions here and there and it messed up the pacing. I dont even want to talk about that Disney resolution, or lack of any closure for some. That said, I did enjoy the main couple when they interacted with other characters. Han Byul and her gossip time with Ho Yeong and Gi Peum? Fun. Her friendship and working relationship with Yoo Sung? Interesting. Tae Sung with his manager? Adorable. Him bickering with Soo Hyuk? Some of the best comedy bits of the show. It amazes me how well these two worked with everyone except each other. I just feel like their relationship was too juvenile. They presented some middle school type of behavior I just did not connect with. And its not like its impossible to show a sweet, cute romance - they did it with the side couple. Yes, it was over the top cute, but thats who the characters were from the start - adorable, so it fitted the overall picture. They also showed a more mature and chill approach with another side couple - a lot better paced even though they had 1/10th of the screen time compared to the mains. All the supporting plots showed me there is a skill and good writing hidden in the show, but somehow they failed to use it for the most important aspects. I definitely enjoyed the few small commentary bits on the entertainment  industry. Some were presented in a more serious manner, some leaned towards comedy. Sh**ting Stars has also one of the best breaking the 4th wall scenes I have seen in dramas for ages. I replied that one scene many times - perfectly executed if you ask me.Performance wise, it varies depending on the actor. Probably one of the worst performances in Lee Sung Kyungs career. She delivered close to nothing. The lines felt flat, the crying scenes evoke zero emotions. She presented little to no variety in her facial expression. And I know for a fact she can do better, she did in her other dramas. She is not an amazing actress, but should be capable of leading a rom-com. Kim Young Dae did fine. I enjoyed his more emotional scenes, he did a good job portraying the vulnerability of Tae Sung. At the same time Tae Sung was just a poorly written character, so its not easy to judge the performance of the actor. Most characters did not have enough depth for the cast to truly showcase the skills they might have. Yes, Yoon Jong Hoon delivered the sweet hard working senior, Kim Yoon Hye was the cute and innocent junior, Park So Jin did an amazing job as a journalist with some internal conflicts and Lee Jung Shin was able to make the arrogant and distant lawyer more approachable and fun. But thats it. The characters dont really serve more than these short descriptions. The production value was nice. Quite a number of scenes had an aesthetic appeal that supported whatever was happening on screen. Talking about the production, we cannot ignore the initial wave of criticism surrounding the uneducated and ignorant depiction of Africa. I still believe this just shows how lazy the writers are (honestly, the same problem happens in all countries, and is not limited to Korea). 15 minutes of google search is too much work for them. Finding a more appropriate way to present a specific plot line? Why waste time, when you can apologize later if it gathers some bad press. Overall, it was painfully mediocre. I enjoyed following some side relationships (be it romantic or platonic) and plot lines, but close to nothing concerning the main two characters was good. They just put random events and ideas together, and did not spend enough time to figure out how to present them in a cohesive way. The show just did not flow well."

The portrayal of people's internal conflicts astounded me. Ae Jin was so helpless at school that she pretended to be someone other than herself most of the time. She found pleasure in her second identity that she couldn't find in herself. The plot moved quickly, and the way things were revealed was intriguing.Cons: The beginning was a lot of fun, but by the time we got to the middle, the drama had sunk. I won't say why because doing so would be a spoiler. I really liked the idea that this drama was attempting to convey.______Acting_____Shim Dal Gi (Koo Ae Jin) and Choi Bo Min performed admirably (Kim Ho In). Dal Gi's performance as Ae Jin was superb, and Bo Min was successful in giving Ho In a psycho yet attractive vibe. He made a favourable first impression on me, and I was encouraged to watch his other dramas. The one flaw in Dal Gi's acting was that she exaggerated her performance. But, at times, I felt it was necessary because she was behaving like a mentally ill person._____Rewatch Value_____The main reason why the rewatch value for this drama is high is because of the amount of episodes and its duration. ______Overall______Shadow Beauty is neither a good nor a bad web series on the whole. This  drama has its own set of weak and strong points. Some may enjoy it, while others may not. It all depends on how you look at it. Personally, I enjoyed it.

""She was Pretty"" is a true story, so they say. It's about love - of course. The first love, too. And about being a woman in South Korea. When is a woman beautiful? And when is she not (anymore)? And what does that mean for her then? For love? For work? For social life? For your self-esteem?That's what this KDrama is about.Wanting to be beautiful as a woman is widespread. Needing to be beautiful as a woman is deeply Korean. In hardly any other country do women spend so much time on skin care and make-up. Impeccability of the personality is reflected (in the South Korean self-image) in the form of pure skin and so facial care is part of a comprehensive ideal of beauty. The KBeauty industry supplies innovative products for this. In Germany, there are an average of three to five care steps that women use for their facial care. South Korea has become known for its ""10-step Korean Skincare Routine"", which (should) lead to a flawless porcelain complexion in lengthy and loving detail work.In my experience, series that deal supposedly critically with ideals of beauty, bullying based on appearance, discrimination based on aesthetic value judgments and norms tend to have a hard time. They can't really be critical since their sponsors often come from the KBeauty industry... And they can rarely present an ""ugly"", ""repulsive"" character as a protagonist if they want the viewer to identify with it and actually watch the series. The subject calls for compromises before the story can even be thought through, let alone be told. Most of the time, this results in a transformation process for the protagonist: she transforms into a beauty that men and women can no longer overlook, and as a result she at last gains (now well deserved) self-esteem.That's why I'm not a fan of this type of series. Even if the actresses are usually very committed, perhaps because the topic is so important to them. But the story can't help it... In the end, the solution is the transformation - the ugly duckling blossoms into a pretty woman and thus causes plenty of ""Aha!"". That doesn't convince me personally, because the core of the problem is rarely shaken, at most it is touched on the shell.Accordingly, ""She was Pretty"" is not among my favorite series. Still I like it. Why? After all, there is the male character of Shin-hyuk. He's a great guy, he's good-looking, he's got what it takes - but he doesn't act like the norm. He takes a close look behind the facades and encounters the human in the woman, not the image of the woman. And falls in love with the woman as she is (before some kind of transformation). I think we need more role models like this. In ""She was Pretty"" at least there is one. It's encouraging and also fun to watch Shin-huyk (refreshingly played by Choi Si-won) in his encounters with the 'Ugly Duckling'.Of course, ugly is relative in this KDrama as always. The protagonist, Kim Hye-jin, was once one of the prettiest girls in her class and totally hip. However, she has inherited her father's skin, which is characterized by a noticeable redness in the cheek area. Also, her hair is naturally frizzy. Although this might disturb the eye of the South Korean viewers, it is actually nothing that cannot be remedied with a few interventions, if a woman wanted to. Hye-jin just doesn't want to. To her it's not worth it (also in monetary terms). Yet that's how she offends people and makes social life and professional life difficult.She compensates for her flaws (and thus her lack of value as a woman) through hard work. At the same time, she and her goodwill constantly invite others to have her be exploited. There's a memorable scene in which she takes on the new job with a competitor. Her co-worker is what you might call pretty (at least she's done a lot to be). As a reward, she is given permission to manicure her nails during working hours and to work rather slowly (if at all). Hye-jin, on the other hand, is passed around, pushed and insulted. The ideal of beauty for women - beyond performance - thus influences hierarchies in the working world. Unfortunately for South Korea this is a widespread status quo.With Hwang Jung-eum and Choi Si-won being in a cheerful mood and providing plenty of fun in the midst of the actually less funny social conditions, the KDrama becomes worth seeing. The exalted editor-in-chief of the lifestyle magazine, who changes her hair color and her outfit with the hour and constantly recites from Italian operas, also ensures a good mood. Ah, yes, this Kdrama is first of all a rom(ance) with some com(edy) in search of a happy ending. Some things may be predictable, but some are not. As far as the beauty-topic ist concerned: Its never too far from the norm, but some socially critical echoes could still be sprinkled nonchalantly throughout the course of the story. ...Humor paves the way for serious messages..."

A love story with wit, charm & affection. Makjang alert. Toxic, too   First of all: ""Shine or Go Crazy"" is a love story from head to toe with all the trimmings. Nevertheless, it is also about the dazzling historical figure of Wang So - King Gwangjong from the early hours of the Goryeo era. Thus it is a beautiful character study about the young prince, who at last became king, but who had by far not been the preferred prince of choice as far as the future throne was concerned.  How did HE happen to become not only king but such an outstanding one as well - one who is NOT automatically (as so often) a jumping jack for his ministers, eunuchs and palace ladies? Who or what motivated and inspired his rather grounded, almost visionary, innovative, citizen-oriented policies? This KDrama offers a (possible) answer to history, as well as an epic love story, playfully sprinkling disguise of origin and confusion of gender.----------------- SIDE NOTE: --- Wang So, 4th son of Goryeo King Wang Geon, and later King Gwangjong During his 26-year reign at the end of the first millennium, King Gwangjong laid solid foundations for the next four centuries. To this end, he introduced some popular reforms for the common people (yet unpopular among the nobility). Above all, these concerned slavery. Additionally he instituted the national civil service exam, which allowed people to serve the country according to their ability. Introduced during his reign, too, were so-called ""Daebi-won"" - medical centers for the free care of the poor. Finally, he secured the borders of the empire with military measures. Throughout, he consistently had to deal with opponing noblemen ... and eliminated them uncompromisingly. ""Shine or Go Crazy"" is a dignified multimedia monument to his rulership, that in general rather focused on the needs of his ordinary citizens than aristocracy.The KDrama ""Shine or Go Crazy"" (as well as ""Moon Lovers"" who deals with King Gwangjong, too), offers a conclusive explanation for this Kings particular career. Whether this is historically justified by sources, I could not find out yet. In any case, Prince Wang So becomes tangible and understandable with the help of this fictional setting: The KDramas tell his story as at a young age being banished from the palace and sent to the mountains - thus hopefully avoiding a bloody prophesy from coming true. There he lived a life beyond the palace intrigues, yet close to nature and its existential everyday struggles for survival. Like that, his everyday life inevitably came quite a bit closer to that of the ordinary people of his time. This socialization in 'freedom' and largely grounded normality shaped him in a completely different way than his (numerous) direct and indirect siblings within the palace walls and thus makes him a resolute and popular monarchical free spirit. At the same time, this lays the right foundation for placing a completely unorthodox, unexpected and inspiring commoners love at his emotional side. Like that the fictional K-Drama helps to on the one hand understand the sharp edges of his disappointment because of parental rejection as well as his self-doubt due to his curse. On the other hand, however, this is balanced by down-to-earth experience of authentic affection and love. Historically true or not, the extrordinary historic personality of prince Wang So is painted in an impressively tangible, comprehensible way.------------------- SIDE NOTE --- Trading at the time ---An aspect of historical detail that's (in general rarely) brought into focus in ""Shine or Go Crazy"", too, is the importance of thriving international trade at the end of the first millennium. Throughout Korean history, life on the peninsula (not only, but also in KDrama) is rather isolated and self-centered. In this story, at least, business relationships with the immediate neighbors and with the rest of the world are given some space, at least to some extent.-------------------- SIDE NOTE --- Balhae / Late BalhaeAlso rarely a topic in the focus of KDrama is the Korean history BEFORE Goryeo - the time of the three kingdoms Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje. In ""Shine or Go Crazy,"" the female protagonist is a princess from the Late Balhae Kingdom in what is now Manchuria. This dates back to one of five kingdoms that in 37 BC united to form the kingdom of Goguryeo. The first Goryeo King Wang Geon (posthumously Taejo) at his time attempted to reconquer the former territories of the original Goguryeo Empire and thus set his kingdom on proven, solid ground. Balhae being one of them, had previously fallen victim to the Para-Mongolian Kitan. Some (many) Koreans from ancient Goguryeo, who formed the ruling Balhaen elite, escaped to Goryeo - with the crown prince, the nobles and parts of the population. The female lead is set in this context (and also personally associated with an alarming (fictitious) prophecy regarding the future of her people.)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Back to the (love) story between the 4th son of Goryeo King Wang Geon and the Balhaean princess, who is an independent  prosperous business woman. In proven KDrama style, there are subplots with their own stories and characters with their own motives, who courageously get involved in the (love) life of Prince Wang So. The political stage is intransigently characterized by malevolent power intrigues. There arent any scruples anywhere. Upright people hardly exist, loyalty and dependence being mixed up and confused. There's a lot of bad stuff going on everywhere. It gets pretty toxic, too. Set in this context is the affectionately and also humourously told relationship of young prince Wang So with a smart, proficient, quite self-confident lady in a double role in disguise as young man. These encounters inspire and enhance Wang Sos pragmatic world view. The dynamic between them is fun to watch - with wit and charm, since his queen of hearts is sometimes hidden behind a veil and sometimes in men's clothes. At times, Wang So has to seriously doubt his gender orientation (... not that this would have deterred him...).Ah. Yes. The ending... Reviews I had read often blamed the ending. I was ready for the worst. Probably that was a good thing. Like that I was pleasantly surprised as I had expected even worse. In fact, whether I liked it or not, the ending made quite a lot of sense to me. (After all, this is about a historical character - the prince becomes king and has an archetypal task that is greater than himself - during his reign, Gwangjong sets the course for future generations.) Nevertheless, KDrama land even got us a little candy at the very end, too. My criticism, however, refers to the soundtrack! Unfortunately, this is the first time I definitely have to complain! Shallow songs can have their time, I dont mind. But in this case (at least in my acustic sound system) as soon as romantic vibes gently started to develop, an inappropriately dull, meaningless song (in my perception)  acustically dominated the scene and thus insensitively destroyed each and every moment (again and again). A real shame! (I would like to hope, that this was just due to my technical device...)"

This is how I would describe this drama and it's over the top appeal. This is not a drama with substance. It's listed as a melodrama, but it is a cartoon version of a melodrama. All of the characters are comedic and over the top, yes even the bad guys. I admit that this was a plus and a minus for me, because sometimes playing certain things up for the comedy made it frustrating to watch, and hard to take seriously. Once I let go of any type of expectations of seriousness, I liked this drama a lot more, but I should be honest... there is only one reason I kept watching in the beginning, and that reason is Seo In Guk.

Seo In Guk as Louis is the main reason to watch this show. I've seen him, and liked him a lot, in other dramas, but I had no idea he could be so hilarious and silly. Louis is a character that could easily become annoying if played by the wrong actor, but instead I totally fell for him and his antics. He also managed to make him feel real in each completely unrealistic scenario this drama put him in, which sucked me even further into the story. Even when the plot let me down, Louis never did.

He's matched with Nam Ji Hyun as Go Bok Shil, another super sweet and likable character who avoids being annoying. She is naive, yet brave, so her innocence wasn't a turn off for me. I also loved that although she is obviously the Cinderella of this story, this never changed the essence of who her character was. Bok Shil and Louis are so incredibly adorkable as a couple, and have such great chemistry, that it felt like watching a real love story in spite of the cheesy plot. Their love story is what the show is all about, so liking them made me automatically like the show, and look forward to each episode.

There is also Yoon Sang Hyun as Cha Joong Won, another actor who I've loved in many other dramas, and he pulls off another memorable character. Playing totally against their sweetness, with each clearing of his throat, he became the hilarious third wheel to complete their love triangle. Although he is a classic ""forever alone"" character, watching his rivalry/bromance with Louis was fun. Honestly, the entire supporting cast is fun to watch. I can't really think of one bad cast member, and considering the cheesy dialogue and scenarios (a certain car ride comes to mind), the fact that they could pull off such over the top comedy so well shows how talented they all are.

What I didn't love is the plot. There were way too many tropes/clichs, and certain scenarios were dragged out way too long. I got so frustrated waiting for Louis' memory to return, or for someone to reveal who he was. Then there was some extreme violence that felt out of place in this extreme comedy, and seemed to be more for shock value. I did love the side stories of some of the characters (their neighbors, the servants, the mom clique...), but the main story of what happened to Louis, and why, seemed really messy. The romance portion does have some sweet closure at the end, though unbelievable, but at that point I liked them so much I just smiled and accepted it. That's how I felt about most of the plot... smile, or laugh, and accept it, even if its completely ridiculous. 

Would I watch this again? Probably not, but maybe. Again, the cast is really cute, so maybe that's enough to justify a second viewing. Maybe Louis' goofy smile is enough. At least the OST is good.

Overall this is a great excuse to watch Seo In Guk be as cute as possible, and a fun drama for those looking for more laughs than tears. It has too many flaws in the plot to make my favorites list, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it on someone else's. Who knew that amnesia, homelessness, robbery, assault, going missing, and family greed could be such hilarious fun? This was a great break from heavier dramas, and I highly recommend it for exactly that reason."

LOL).  In four episodes, this drama covers a lot - training, competition, family, friendship and romance.  Theres a lot to like about this drama and also a few areas I dont like very much.What I Like:1. Found Family - I love all the scenes at the boarding house.  The cozy and comfortable feeling, and friendly banter between friends and families.  Having family meals together is the best thing!2. Rivalry to Camaraderie - As with many similar dramas, the drama started with the rivalry between the two male leads, a veteran super star vs a newly discovered rising star.  I enjoy all the scenes of them together.3. Parents/Children relationship - We see the contrasting relationships between Man Bok & his mother and Eun Ho &  his father.  Though Man Bok is poor financially, his relationship with his mom and sister is rich in every other aspect.  A loving mother to everyone and a loving and responsible son.  On the other hand, Eun Ho is rich yet his relationship with his father is cold.  He has to find comfort and warmth in the boarding house.What I have Mixed Feelings:1. Romance - Romance is really unnecessary and this is a big criticism coming from me since I am a romance lover.  With only 4 short episodes, I would love to see more about friendship, family and competition.  I dont see why the two male leads are attracted to Jin Na at all.  She might be pretty, but then what else?  If I have to choose romance, I would love to see more of Man Hee and her new crush.2. K-pop - similar to romance, the whole K-pop audition storyline could be eliminated.  It doesnt bring much to the drama.  Also, they should have let the actress sing during her audition instead of playing a different song.3. Skating scenes - I feel that there isnt enough competition or racing scenes in this drama thats about speed skating.  The few that we have are not exciting enough.  I am especially disappointed in the Olympic trials.  No exciting racing scenes at all.  I didnt even know the leads were reaching the finish line until they announced the winner.  Other Random Observations:1. Kim Do Yeon can really dance.  2. I noticed the skating scenes seem to be slower than in C-dramas such as To Fly with You.  Maybe C-dramas speed up those scenes digitally?"

Hope for romance and love has given way to various, quite specific experiences... and these are inevitably paved with disappointment and suffering, too.  However, its not necessarily too late for a new love. It might be different, though. More grounded. Honest. Upright. Less games. Sincere closeness and warmth become more important than romantic squabble. The time ahead is finite. And you no longer expect a fairy tale full of magic, but rather wish for true moments, a safe place to catch your breath and recharge your batteries. Reliability. Trust and emotional intimacy.The protagonists in ""Should we Kiss First"" have all been through life for some time. The two main characters have had children and lost them again, have been married and divorced, lived more or less honest but empty lives. SHE has been a stewardess for 20 years and suffers from insomnia. HE is a co-founder of an advertising agency and has cancer. Neither of them want to be alone. Neither of them want a relationship. Hm. Difficult. Their best friends each want to pair them off ... and at last are successful. However - being in makjang KDrama Land - the past of the protagonists gets involved in the present and triggers a lot of turbulence.""Should we Kiss First"" focuses on two adults who (re)experience love in a way they never expected. Love is not primarily supple, sexy and redeeming, but presents itself as irrational, brittle, stubborn and complex. As such, it demands one thing unconditionally: complete surrender to this feeling, which remains in spite of  adversities, yet does not solve any problems. However gives the necessary strength to face them.Does this power come from the love you experience from someone? Or from the love that you give yourself? The beauty of this KDrama is placing the emphasis on the fact that it is your own radiance which makes a difference. The love  we open up to and give in to makes the difference how we experience life, or what options we recognize and choose... It's about giving in to your feelings, letting them be (even if you rather not put up with it) and trusting them.The story is told in different nuances - sometimes humorous, sometimes profound, sometimes tender, sometimes playful, sometimes harsh, even fists are flying at times. Enjoying the moment to the fullest and the pure love of life have just as much space as the desolate moments of emptiness, embarrassment, destructive anger and listless lethargy. The dialogues are carefully chosen down to the last detail. And then there are the subplots, that round the story off. A three-dimensional, grown-up love story. Yes, once again a story about love, but not cheesy. Instead, the story is sensitively told, spiritedly acted and filled with a love for detail. On top of that, a story full of sometimes subtle, sometimes explicit wisdom. A KDrama that doesn't sugarcoat anything, yet feeds you with a satisfying sigh."

There is this thing with a 10 point rating. Some give it very easily, some almost never give 10 points. As for me, it's like this: If a drama is successfully absorbing me into its universe and everything just seems to be perfect to me, then it reached a point where it's worth receiving my whole dedication. It doesn't matter if others say, there are flaws in it, whether it's true or not. I just don't see them anymore as I am part of that new  world where there are no 'story-faults' and such things.

Signal was successful in every matter.

Story. 
First episode and it just pushes you right in the middle of the event. You get immediately drawn to the characters, the suspense and the story. You don't have time to take a deep breath, instead you completely hold it. And when you think it's over and you can take some minutes to rest, the next incident is already starting and you just get sucked in again. If you're lucky, you get some minutes to reminisce about and take in what just happened. But as the story continues, the suspense intensifies and breaks loose in a shocking finale.

Characters. 
They like to play with your emotions. Ups and downs, but most of all excitement and anxiousness. Plenty of. The acting was on point, it captivates you. There is this female cop you're dealing with. And there's the present version and a past version of her. They are completely different as the older version has matured and became stronger. You just see the growth. And there's this guy. You see him and you want to help him. You see his conviction and his struggle. You just want to be by his side, so he won't be the lonely hunter in a forest full of wolves. And then there's this boy. He's so full of himself and full of hate for others and the world. But he gets a chance and a view from another angle. And he takes it. And don't forget this villian. You don't know about him right away but you soon grow to hate him like no other. Extremely. Wholeheartedly.

Music.
Every minute, every scene, every moment. It just fits. It just gives you this special feeling about the story and its meaning. And then there's this nostalgic feeling to it. You can't even discribe it. It just takes you back in time and like you're reminiscing about your own past, it carries this wistful desire to actually go back, live again and maybe change something.

Background.
To get to know that many cases are real-time cases makes the drama even heavier and impacting. Sometimes you think writers create scary non-realistic monsters. But truth be told, our world, our reality creates the most fearsome monsters you just wouldn't believe them to exist among us.

Message.
Whether there is one or not. Everyone has to decide that for themselves. But the drama depicts some really interesting and worth thinking about questions. Most of all: What would you do if you could change the past?

I think I would have felt a lot differently  had I seen this one or 2 episode per week. The bitch watching, i mean the binge watching has helped me cope with my week.Second, its rare to see a Korean BL series that is not long but doesnt feel rushed. This one has the perfect pacing and rightly focused on the main characters, without the unnecessary fillers. The creators have amply contained the storyline and used what little time they have in progressing the story.Third, my goodness the soundtrack is amazing. Is that the real voice of Jang Do Yoon cause he sounds divine? The first main song ""Letter of Apology"" and the last song ""Second Wind"" are both emotional and perfectly sung!Fourth, and I don't know if I still need to mention this, but the two main leads made me fall in love with their characters. They are both really pleasant to look at and believable - even when they were playing young students to the time that they were living together chasing their dreams, I cant even believe that both actors are already in their late 20s.Understandably, the show isn't perfect. I specially find it unbelievable that the guitar teacher became a newly-debuted idol at his age - he looks a bit old to be  honest. However i did appreciate the series'way of tying his storyline without him being too evil.I also noticed how super physically touchy the male characters around Han Ba Ram  -sometimes to an uncofortable degree. It happened both with the teacher and then with Im Han Tae. 'One would feel and see they were clearly leading him on. I would have misinterpreted those moves myself if Im around these 2 guys. But when Ba Ram told them about his feelings both of them acted surprised - and I really found it perplexing in Han Tae's case since I thought he himself was inloved with Baram eversince episode 1. However, despite its flaws, I still find myself pining for the leads and cheered for the triumph of their love story.  For me, the strongest part of the whole series is when Ba Ram and Han Tae  were just hanging out together. Great easy watch for a day (or two) and will relatively be easy to re-watch on a rainy day. Overall, I give it a 9 out of 10."

Upon paper, screenwriters Jeon Chan Ho ( Fates and Furies) and Lee Jae In  ( Fates and Furies) s  Sisyphus The Myth  is a masterpiece work filled with intriguing ideologies of time, science-fiction and an array of intriguing characters and concepts .However, the series often fell short  of logic and characterisation over the course of the storyline. Before addressing the issues surrounding the show, it is important to establish that  the main cast consisting principally of Cho Seung Woo , Kim Byung Chul, Tae In Ho ( playing Tae Sooks mysterious friend and co-founder of their group, Eddy Kim) , Chae Jong Hyeop ( performing as the restaurant delivery man Choi Jae Sun who befriends Seo-hae) , Jung Hye  Jin ( Kim Seo Jin), Kim Jong Tae ( Seo Haes father; Kang Dong Gi ) and Park Shin Hye were fairly good within their performances . On the other hand, questionable dialogue exchanges and the characterisation  often demeaned the quality of screenwriting. The  premise itself is fairly straightforward; Han Tae-sool (Cho Seung-woo), a brilliant engineer, will invent a time-travel machine in the near future, however, something terrible happened afterwards which caused terrible events to occur  . For time travellers seeking sanction from this  dystopian future, they travel back en mass to the era before Tae-Sool invented this revolutionary machine as a  safe place .One of those immigrants is Kang Seo-hae (Park Shin-hye), a mysterious girl who seems to have an undeniable link to Tae-Sool, however, Seo-Hae faces her own conflicts in the meantime between being chased after the mysterious  men in black of the drama, the DEA -who capture and contain time travellers under the guise working for the governments  Immigration Control Unit.  Meanwhile, Tae-Sool becomes interested in the fate of his seemingly deceased brother which leads him down a rabbit hole of danger and mystery as well as leading him to  meeting Seo-Hae. As Seo-Hae and Tae-Sools lives become more interconnected, the two soon begin to realise their feelings for one another, as they fight against a seemingly inevitable future. Wherever the shows dilemmas manifested themselves, the main source  of the problem  manifested with one thing prominently ; the writing. It is fair to say that  Sisyphus; The Myth attempts to have it both ways; an engaging time-travel story with fast-paced action, and a complicated  love story between its main protagonists. Characters were often enforced into scenarios which made little sense within their individual circumstances . For example, illegal future immigrant broker Park Hyeong-do (Sung Dong-il) gets an -out -of character  backstory as well as a shocking revelation in the final episode, that was simply illogical. Even our main protagonists Tae-sool and Seo-Hae were often shoehorned into scenarios which made little sense , reducing  them to become nothing more than plot mechanisms against their more intriguing individual personalities and intriguing backstories ( which felt fairly underdeveloped). Whilst the show attempted to rig emotions between the two main protagonists  in their sudden epiphany around the halfway point that  we like one another against all odds of our circumstances, the cataclysmic  writing underpinning their relationship made theirs  arguably one of the least convincing and forgettable romantic pairings of recent years .In addition to this, theres also the other issue regarding the actual laws of time-travel. Sisyphus; The Myth is independent from its predecessors time-travel takes in Korean film and TV by focusing upon the actual concept of time travel, rather than choosing the  wrinkle-in-time concept, in which  characters from two different timelines coexist, come up time and again. However, time-travel stories can soon become a Gordian knot ( pun intended)  of tangled logic and interest  very  quickly, something which soon became prominent in the series . The screenwriters of Sisyphus added different rules throughout, only to consistently break them and toss logic out of the window , as well as new technologies or magical drugs which delivered anti-climatic scenarios to seemingly impossible problems. Admittedly when   the  drama entered its second-half and introduced viewers to the main antagonist , Sigma (Kim Byung-chul), the show   did undeniably shift towards becoming   more focalised upon the theme of  time-travel, however, as a result of this , the  shows weaknesses overall quickly began to rise to prominence  also. The halfway point resulted in the direction of plot and the ideology of time travel feeling  more like a storyline filler and an excuse for   for high-budget extravaganza scenes, often with little serving purpose than to make viewers squeal with excitement at eye-popping CGI and distract attention away from more notable flaws  .   Admittedly, the series against all odds was fairly engaging within certain sold set pieces and storylines .  Park In Hyes  fight scenes  helped to make the show entertaining  . However, whilst the myriads of  goons of the nefarious control centre featured prominently, this scenario soon became repetitive and formulaic; the duo would face a problem, they would be surrounded and  Tae-sools on-the-spot science to get out of close scrapes (never held up to scrutiny), whilst  Seo-Haes Laura-Croft-Style combat scenes  would  help to save the day also. As the gimmicks became less and less inventive, these concepts soon  died off completely and therefore resulting in numerous action scenes  being tapered off entirely . Several episodes towards the end of the show featured no set pieces at all and the control centre disappeared completely , with several major characters not featuring in the finale  ( with few reasons given) . Additionally , whilst the ending was  bittersweet, it felt inherently poorly-written and the epitome of a classic deus ex  machina ;  a lazing, anticlimactic  ending which created  hare-brained   and problems  towards time paradoxes . Whilst  Sisyphus; The Myth had an intriguing premise, a high budget and an ensemble of a talented actors at its disposal, not even top notch actors such as Park Shin Hye and Cho Seung-Woo could truly save the series from its own demise of abandoned logic, poorly-written characters and relationships, as well as the ineffable disappearances of main characters over the course of the series and a lazy ending  also.Another classic example of the recent trend of high-budget science-fiction and action throwaway extravaganzas such as  Alice and  RUGAL with intriguing premises, yet truly lacking well-written and memorable storylines. Worth binge-watching to waste time with little else to do, yet certainly  not worth  investing  genuine time towards."

Two of them feel like very endearing supporting characters. (Bang ji/ Mu hyul) Two of them are disguised idiots who insult the term. (Boon Yi/General Syeong Hi) The acting prowess also varies in the same order. (Deteriorating as it descends) Boring Middle:Except of a few outstanding scenes the middle of the show does come with a lot of 'meh'. Endless, tiresome and less than impressive politics. Where the writers keep trying to find new and new problems for the main guys to fight against, often not even properly solving the previous ones. I almost put the show on-hold here. Shitty antagonists:Except one, all antagonists are pretty mediocre with lame strategies and they keep getting replaced. As soon as a villain gains solid footing and identity, the show do's away with it in some way. Makes the back and forth a bit boring since the good guys are way too strong and for a very long time SFD does not take any risks. Cop-Outs:Again, the middle is problematic. The show uses huge ass convenient plot devices to get out of complications and some illogical things don't add up. Character Development:This is also a strength of the drama. While for some the CD is brilliant, others (Bang Ji/Moo Hyul) could do with more of it. Friendship/brotherhood is one of the highlights of SFD, however it could've easily been more explored and impactful.  No good female characters:Literally all of them suck/are weak af except one and she isn't even a major role. The female lead is like a blank brainless floppy fish with her wide eyes and sputtering lips. I wanted to slap her silly The Epic:? Yi Bang Won. Yi Bang Won. Yi Bang Won ?The most fleshed out/dynamic/well developed character of the show and easily one of the best anti-heroes in K-Drama History. He's simply wonderful. Yoo Ah In did the acting of a lifetime- Out of this world.Among a sea of self-righteous fuckers, he's a hell wrecker. He's evil, good, kind, reckless, weak, strong, deadly, vulnerable, lonely, childish, manipulative, magnificent, insecure, ambitious, a mastermind but above all- he's wholly human. I just don't have enough words. He was the biggest and at times, the only reason I stuck with this show till the end. The moment SFD plunged into monotony, Yi Bang Won was the one who changed the course with all that shit he stirred up. I haven't been this in love with a character, since Empress Ki's Emperor. Truly excellent. Music:Holy fuck. This is without a doubt the best OST I have ever heard. Whether it be lyrical or instrumental, whether it be sung by characters or played in the background- every song was perfect. Perfectly timed, perfectly meaningful and perfectly emotional. Just perfect.Action/Swordsmanship:Some of the best action scenes in a drama can be scene in SFD. They are always important too because our guys emote with their blades and no fight is meaningless.High Quality Production:Beautiful camera work. Brilliant direction amd screenplay. Very pretty angles. Gorgeous sceneries. Crisp cinematographySuspense:The drama has some legit chill inducing, goosebump worthy scenes and some brilliant cliffhangers that promise something exquisite in the next ep. What's more is the next ep always delivers on its promise. So every episode has a great start, a great end and an okay-ish middle.Last couple of episodes:While the show significantly picks up at episode 30 and maintains the level of great, the last few eps are just plain awesomeness. My heart was hurting, breaking, sputtering, palpitating and melting all at the same time.Moral Dilemmas:Fickle human nature at its finest.Sambong/Moo Hyul/Li Bang Ji:The acting done hy Kim Hyung Min is spectacular- Sambong is a genius. The sexy and passive Bang Ji and the big man with a big heart Moo Hyul are all golden aspects of the show.The End:Very satisfying.History:Most historically accurate show I've watched. It's almost all there. All real. 50 hours worth, is it easy to watch?Yes and no. Some episodes are so gripping and well-executed that you can't help but bulldoze through but some drag enough that you have to actually motivate yourself to push forward. Conclusion: The Epic far outweigh The Flaws. This is a show that is a must-have under your belt as a drama fan. A classic that lives up to the hype.Definitely reccomended."

Enjoy it while it lasts because you dont know whats coming.   It's a quote by Marty Rubin in my titleSnowdrops are the first flowers that bloom in the spring. It is a sign of the end of long and cold winter. This white and delicate bell-shaped flower symbolizes purity and hope. The title itself us a glipmse of the content of the drama and that itself is compelling enough to convince you to watch the drama. I originally watched this for Jisoo and to find the meaning of the title. I had doubts as well as great expectations for this drama and I can assure you that it vanquished all by doubts and overcame all my expectations.Snowdrop is adapted from the handwritten notes of a man who escaped from a prison camp in North Korea. This is director and screenwriter of this drama are Jo Hyun Taek and Yoo Hyun Mi respectively, who also worked together in the drama SKY Castle. Due to the drama accussed of being set against the backdrop of the 1987 Democracy Movement in South Korea or the June Struggle, which is an important historical event for the South Korea as it led to the establishment of democracy is South Korea, and it bringing the people of  Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) to good light, it faced many controversy before and after release. JTBC released their first official statement on the controversy on March 26 that read, ""The drama is not distorting the pro-democracy movement nor is it glorifying the Agency for National Security Planning. It is a black comedy drama satirizing the political situation between the two Koreas under the authoritarian government in the 1980s. Also, it is a romance drama showing young people who sacrifice their love."" On March 30, JTBC released a second statement regarding the controversy that read, ""Snowdrop is set around the 1987 presidential election, and not a drama that deals with the pro-democracy movement"". Also, the Blue House did not intend to interfere in its production adducing the protection of freedom of expression in South Korea's Broadcasting Law, which guarantees broadcasters' independence and prohibits extrajudicial regulation or interference.To simply put the plotline, Eun Young-ro is a freshman in Hosoo Women's University in Seoul and Lin Soo-ho (Jung Hae-in), a North Korean spy sent on a mission to South Korea. They first meet during a group blind date and Young-ro falls for him at first sight. After this incident, they kept running into eachother, which led to Young-ro hiding and taking care of him in her dorm despite the strict rules and dangerous situation, whithout knowing he was a North Korean spy, when he jumped into the dorm injured while being chased by ANSP agents. She also helped him to escape from the dorm without suspecion. The period when Young-ro took care of  Soo-ho was the time when he started to have feeling for her. Again, while being chased while accomplishing the mission, he enters a shrine, without knowing that it led to the dromitory. This inadvertantly led to him keeping the students hostages, to escape. From here, the pair's story begins to unfold against a political disruption. There are other main characters other than Young-ro and Soo-ho in this drama. Jang Seung Jo plays Lee Kang-Moo, a NSA agent who dosen't obey orders from his superiors. He has a fiance Jang Ha-Na played by Jung Eugene, whom he left for some reason and joined NSA. She too later joined NSA to find him. Yoo In Na plays Dr. Kang Cheong-Ya, a National Medical Center surgeon. She is also Nam Tae-Il's, Secretary General of the Democratic Aemin Party, mistress. Yoo Se Ah plays Pi Seung Hee, the strict yet caring housemother of the Hosoo dormitory. Kin Hae Yoon plays Kye Boon Ok, the telephone attendent of the dorm, who was at first friendly to Young-ro. All these characters have an important part to play in this drama. There are many supporting characters too who are indispensable for the progress of the story.Snowdrop well succeeded in deceiving the audience at first. Most of the charactres in this drama have secret or hidden identities and a back story to tell us, which changes our perspective of the drama and the character. All these makes the character and the story rich and intriguing.Although most of the drama is made in one set, the dorm, it is really interesting to watch. The mood of the drama changes episode by episode. In the first episode, it felt like Snowdrop was going to be a light and fluffy rom-com but, the whole mood changed as the episode ended. This drama is an emotional roller-coaster which takes us through each and every emotion possible to be felt by a human. The drama became serious and dangerous as the story went on. This drama is a slow-burn romance drama with political and melodramatic elements. Also, unlike someother dramas, the story started intersting and it didn't cease being interesting. You can't guess that they are going to show next. I was hooked from the very star till the very end of the drama. And when we come to acting, I don't know what to say. As I said before, I came to watch this drama because of the cast. As I recently wandered into the k-dramaland, among the actors of this drama, I was only familiar with Blackpink's Jisoo and Yoo In-na from Goblin. Some of the actors like Jung Hae In and Kin Hye Yoon are the ones I have only heard of and always wanted to watch their shows. So, I took this opportunity to satisfy all my wants and wishes.I have heard that Jung Hae In expresses his feeling through this eyes and smile. Through this drama, I realised that it is ultimately true! His eyes spoke so much emotions that I could have watch his eyes alone to understand the whole moods of the drama. The character of Lim Soo-ho needed aura of mystery and secretiveness but really caring and warm personality. Jung Hae In had it and gave his all too make his character perfect. I have become his fan through this drama and he is now my favourite k-drama actor!I came to watch  Snowdrop, mainly to watch Jisoo's acting. I wasn't really ecpecting anyting but, the usually average idol acting. But, I was really astonished and stunned watching her performance. At first, I didn't even believe my own eyes! I really can't believe that it's her first time acting in main role. She just nailed her character perfectly. Throughout the drama, she had to act many emotional scenes and she acted like a professional veteran actress who have done many projects!Do I have to say about the other actors? They were all amazing. Yoo In-na as usual and nailed her characted perfectly which her acting skills and charms. As I had said before, she was the only actress whose acting I was familiar with. So, I don't know how the other actors are usually. But, in this drama, they were flawless. I wasn't disappointed with anyone's acting. Everyone were perfect for their roles.Jung Hae In ang Jisoo's chemistry is beyond words. It is one of the most convincing and heartbreaking chemistry I have ever seen. Although,  there were some inadvertant misunderstanding between them, their love was deep, pure and passionate.  The makeup and costumes in this drama have a key role in setting the mood and vibes of the audience regarding the story. Costumes and makeup give the audience perception of the character wearing it and the time period the story is set in.  Depending upon the role, the costumes and makeup may reveal truths or hide secrets. The makeup and costumes of the actors were really nice. It made them look like the people from the 80s. The cinematography of this drama too is ideal. The drama have many nice OSTs in both Korean and English that takes us to the 1980s ambience. Some of them are:""If You're with Me"" by Sung Si-kyung""Friend"" by Kim Hee-won""Looks Like a Real Thing"" (Korean and English version available) by JeHwi""Wishes"" by Jamie Miller""Memories More than Love"" by Kevin OhAmong these amazing OSTs, Friend and Memories More than Love are my personal favourites.A quote from Harry Potter goes, ""It is choices that shows us who we truly are far more than our abilities"". This drama too is about the choises that the characters take. Though Soo-ho was forced to make many choices which were against his will, he choose what is right in the end. He was a righteous person from the very beginning but, his obligations to his nation made him desperate. There are many other characters in this drama who was like Soo-ho, on whom choices were imposed, making them hopeless. They too changed and stood with what is right.This drama shows the political dispute between Noth and South Korea. It's hard to explain their relationship. I was really confused about the political part of the drama at first too. As this was my first historical political-fiction drama, everything seemed too difficult for me to digest. But, it got better. I know that I truly and unquestionably like a drama if the skip botton lies idle throughout the drama. Such a drama was Snowdrop for me. Throught the course of 12 episodes, there wasn't a dull or boring moment for me.""Your future is whatever you make it"" - this is a quote I liked form Snowdrop. Altough the person saying it didn't say it in a good sense (I won't say who said it. It will be a spoiler), what the person said is undoubtebly true. This reflect the Harry Potter quote I said before.""Of course, love is more important than ideology or principles. Whether you are man or women this is the truth of lofe""- this is another quote I loved.I won't say anything about the ending. I don't wish to spoil anything for the future watchers who are reading this review.Overall, this is one of the best dramas I have seen in my life. Of course, this is not perfect, it had its own flaws. Well, nothing is perfect in this universe. But, this dosen't keep me from giving this drama a perfect 10. It has all elements a drama should have to make it enjoyable and emotionally engaged. This drama is amazing through and through. I will certainly recommend this to anybody who is in need of a well-written, amazingly directed drama with amazing actors and chemistry. Note: Let me know in case of any mistakes or faults."

Have you ever watched a drama which starts off with cataclysmic screenwriting and then surprisingly  grows on you in the second-half ? Well, most watchers can probably agree that this ideology epitomises  So, I Married An Anti-Fan with its surprising turn from certain cliches to an endearing relationship between our leads. However those expecting So I Married An Anti-Fan to be a masterpiece should probably be told outright that this drama isnt without its flaws either. Taking  nearly three years to air ( after finishing production in 2018) and sparking an eruption of mixed criticism by viewers afterwards ,  So, I Married An Anti-Fan is a drama which has greatly divided the audience demographic  . Some viewers take the stance that it is "" too reminiscent of the tacky 2000s abusive relationships"" and "" poorly-written"", whilst others on this platform defend this as "" sweet"" and a "" comfort drama"".  However, this raises the bigger question for those wanting to watch the show for the first time; is it actually worth watching? Well, there are some undeniable strengths which may have an alluring charm for certain watchers.   The  main cast  (consisting of  Choi Soo Young, Choi Tae Joon, Hwang Chan Sung and Han Ji An) were  an absolute delight, the plot  was "" romantic and fluffy with a twist of melodrama"", and it was  straightforward enough to follow ( in an "" unplug your brain"" sort of  way ). Refreshingly, the second-half took a slightly more  serious stance to our main leads relationship by delving into the main leads interactions, whilst also addressing more  profound  insights into the idol industrys sociocultural issues  in South-Korea. However, this is also where we must address the opposite side of the coin; the problems. One of the biggest dilemmas of  So, I Married An Anti-Fan came through character development. Lets start off this example with our female lead Lee Geun Young. Geun Young was a female lead  who you desperately tried to like as a viewer as Choi Soo Young is a  good actress. Undeniably as a character, she isnt ""naive"" or the "" sweet girl next door"" and will happily stand her ground at times  when the male lead kicks off. However, ultimately this is where our biggest problem occurs with Geun Young; she exists( for a major proportion of the series) as a component of an enforced pairing for the  sake of plot . There is nothing  wrong per say with a female lead being in a relationship in a drama. ( In fact  it can allow god-tier character development . ) However whilst we did get to see Geun Young come round to accepting  her feelings in the second-half, this first part  felt more like a carte blanche for Geun Youngs character development by screenwriters Kim Eun Jung and Nam Ji Yeon in order to forcefully pair-off Geun Young with our male lead  Hoo Joon. Consequently Geun Young was rarely given time to understand exactly why she was attracted to the "" jerk who ruined her life"" ( the motiveless goal  aside from her obsessive desire to "" ruin his life""). Sadly further  interactions with her mother and friends provided little insight into her actual personality (beside the romantic pairing). Then theres the male lead Hoo Joon. Similar to Soo Young, Tae Joon is a dynamic  actor and there were certainly intriguing issues tackled with his character; a popular star who is getting fed up of being used by his company and his tiresome  lifestyle. However typical of cliches, he was often glorified by his role throughout the drama as the "" stoic, jerk male lead ; getting away with assault, bribery and blackmail (including  towards the female lead). The show attempted to play an uno reverse card by introducing the "" tragic backstory"" which may evidently cause mixed-feelings for viewers. Of course the issue of our main leads also remains  a source of mixed-criticism for the drama.  On one side, there  is the undeniable problem that the male lead Hoo Joon constantly found ways to emotionally gaslight the female lead   ; grabbing Geun Youngs  wrist , then giving her the cold shoulder over the most trivial of matters  and refusing at times to hear her side of the story (or just talk to her like a decent  human being). However, there is an alternate stance that  So I Married An Anti-Fan isnt supposed to be perfect. Its a romantic-comedy which attempts to reflect the real-life reality that actual relationships are messy and problematic. The focalised writing decision to focus more on our main leads relationship in the second-half did seem to prove that this was the intention of the drama.Although  this review would not be complete without talking about  one of the biggest elephants in the room; our supporting characters JJ ( Hwang Chan Sung) and Oh In Hyung ( Han Ji An)s overly problematic relationship. Hwang Chan Sung is a really good actor, however,  you could imagine if there was an  Encyclopaedia Of The Most Obsessive Second Male Leads Of All Time, his character JJ would have been on the first page. It was evident that the drama desperately tried for  us (as viewers) to root for JJ as the  pining lover. However , this appeared difficult when his behaviour reflected an otherwise dysfunctional and oppressive  figure in In Hyungs life by rifling around In Hyungs room ( without her permission),  screaming at her manager down the phone in public ( and thus purposefully embarrassing In Hyung in front of people)  and then even  attempting to manipulate  Geun Young ( without considering In Hyung or Geun Youngs feelings)  early on in the series in order to get back at Hoo Joon.Yet whilst it would be easy to pin all the blame on JJ, Oh In Hyung had her own fair share of problems also .  Similar to her costars Han Ji An is a good actress. In terms of her character In Hyung, the drama works incredibly hard to make us feel pity for her being  a   a victim of the   malicious industry of idols and JJs obsessive infatuations. ( For the most part as viewers we certainly do.) However as we delve more into the show ( without spoilers), it soon becomes apparent that In Hyung is manipulated by the screenwriting into  becoming a tiresome plot mechanism in order to trigger catalytic events in the later storyline.  Oh boy, then theres the additional problem of the  producers. Admittedly they do not have such a prominent role in the second-half, however, most viewers will probably agree that they were incredibly irksome characters. Yes they were supposed to add a touch of comedy during more angst-ridden moments of the show, however, secretly filming the leads without their permission, screaming at the camera crew, forcing, guilt-tripping and then humiliating Geun Young on multiple occasions just grew  fairly irksome for viewers . Nevertheless the ending was a left on a sweet note for viewers. Although admittedly there could have been some plot points wrapped up, it was entertaining to have some closure with our finale. So, is So I Married An Anti-Fan"" actually worth watching? Whilst the show has a fairly good cast and is easygoing for viewers looking for an escape from darker romance storylines, this depends entirely on personal taste. For fans of ""cutesy"" romance with a "" slice of 2000s K-drama relationship abuse angst"" or just looking for a show to unplug your brain with,then this drama is right up your street. However, drama watchers looking for a more profound storyline then look elsewhere as "" So, I Married An Anti-Fan"" isnt it."

However whilst the show did present some intriguing messages towards recognising diversity and fighting against prejudice stereotypes in South-Korean society,  So Not Worth It often failed to hit the mark by struggling to reach its full potential. The acting is admittedly a mixed-bag. As the majority of the cast are comprised of novice or first-time actors, it is undeniable that the acting quality varied a lot. During more heartfelt moments of the show, the cast were able to give dynamic performances, however, comical elements surrounding their characters was a little questionable to say the least. As characters, the show often reimbursed into going into extremes of being over-the-top stereotypes. Teaching assistant  Se Wan ( Park Se Wan) was arguably less  overtly flamboyant than the other characters in the series due to her down-to earth personality and  constant need to have other part-time  jobs in order  to survive. Consequently  , this was closely followed by Hyun Min  ( Han Hyun Min). There seemed to be a lot that the series was trying to address with Hyun Mins difficult lifestyle  as a student as well as annoyingly being mistaken as a foreigner. By far, there  were certainly some interesting and funny moments with Hyun Mins interactions around  sister Han Hyun A ( Choi Yu Jin) and his mother, however, more controversial issues which were prominent with Hyun Moms character  were often swept under the carpet . The  series enjoyed playing and milking on the comedy elements a lot also. It is therefore no surprise that  clueless  and klutzy  Korean- American Jamie ( Shin Hyun Seung) soon began to predominate screentime  with his predictable pairing with Se Wan. Refreshingly as we progress we do learn a bit more about Jamie outside of the comical moments regarding his complicated life, however, it did feel at times this portrayal was a little lacking. ( As the series could have even helped to portray difficulties for Jamie trying to adapt  to a different culture.)The other supporting characters such as Korean - Australian Sam ( Choi Young Jae), Hyun Mins  roommate Tetris ( Tetris Brown) and  their   roommate  Hans ( Joakim) were often used to generate quick farce moments in the show rather than being used to reach more poignant moments . It was evident to a lot of watchers just how much this show had been tailored for western audiences. This isnt a surprise considering the popularity of K-dramas in the west, however, the stereotypes in order to appeal to  westernised audiences were incredibly enforced such as Thai K-drama fan Minnie( Minnie)s constant references to K-drama quotes or actors in order to make the show "" appealing . ( Including a cringeworthy moment when Minnie is visiting an army barrack and begins to reference  Descendants of the Sun"".)  Then there was the American international student  Carson ( Carson Allen). As viewers, we admittedly did get to see some brief glimpses into Carsons love-life which helped to sketch her out more as an individual. However, her  old-man style of speaking often took away more profound moments of her character by being used as   a  tiresome running gag in the show.Of course it is wrong to suggest that  So Not Worth It didnt have some more bittersweet moments either. There was a fairly intriguing element to a group of international students becoming friends which was fortified by standing up for one another at different moments in the show. When Carson reveals her Korean boyfriend had an affair behind her back,  the ragtag group of friends are quick to rush over to  give him an earful. In another scene of this episode, Se Wan and Carson have a fairly sweet  moment as friends, whilst in a later episode Hyun Mins mother makes a profound point that being a mother isnt just a biological, but having a strong bond  with your child ( regardless of whether they are blood-related or not) also .  In another heartfelt moment of the show, Carson altruistically plans  matchmaker with Terris and her date  after cottoning onto to Terris feelings  . Yet in between the more profound moments of the series, the boorish comedy often took this away in exchange for childish and tiresome jokes and running gags . The ending was arguably left on the possibility for a second season with a feeling for incompleteness for viewers , however, a lacking sense of fulfilment truly did bring to the question what on earth viewers spent 12 episodes watching . So is  So Not Worth it  worth  investing time towards ? If youre looking for a quick series to binge-watch then this sitcom is the answer to your dreams. However, the desired attempt to present a diverse cast evidently targeted for a quick fix to attract western audiences  was strongly apparent over quality. There was a certain glamorisation over more subtle issues in South-Korean society  with numerous one-dimensional  characters in an attempt to heighten   poorly-written  farce moments."

The idea of the new chatbot she invents fits the current times and often hopelessly automatized behaviours of modern humans. She herself uses her chatbot and one evening decides to meet the creepy chat match instead of the normal nice guy she is talking to at the same time. Meeting that obviously creepy guy is weird and intense for her, the cinematography and music in the first episodes is really good, artsy and fitting the entire mood it wants to transport. So while  we find out the very first episode that the creepy looking guy is indeed a creep and crazy serial killer for that, we undertand that somehow he likes our female lead too and does not intend to kill her (or at least most of the time I guess).So the pictures, the tension and the music are really well done in the first few episodes. The side characters are - ok. The shaman friend seems interesting but her story isn't well explored, sadly she remains pale because that lack of background.The other friend of our progammer lady is a female detective who, after an accident, is wheelchair bound. Our  serial killer seeks the cop lady  out specifically on the chat bot luring her in with pretending he is in a wheel chair too.  (how he is able to do that we don't know) For some unknown reason he does not kill her though, but leaves her out in the wild without her wheelchair.  I did wonder though why did he not kill her as she could have easiyl intentified him? Also, why did she  not check the police records for his face she being a police woman? By the middle of the show it gets all rather slow and several things that happen seemed forced and incoherent to me and I started feeling a little annoyed.It seemed like the creators wanted to put certain things into the story no matter what and how. So the shaman woman is into women and it seems kind of forced that they almost artificially create a situation for her to meet a woman and get it going with her. No problem with that if it fits the story and you feel a connection to the character. That chance was missed in my opinion and so it just seems like they wanted this to somehow happen in that show.  Same thing goes for the handicapped cop lady. So she is a cop but although being in a wheelchair and thus comparably helpless she goes to a blind date with an unknown guy she just talked to per chat for a bit, and she doesn't meet him in public but is gullibly being lured into the wild to a forsaken swimmingpool sowewhere in the great nowhere? Would a cop, let alone a handicapped cop do such dumb thing really?  So then you have to just  accept that quite accidentally, in a multi million city like Seoul, the serial killer gets involved with programmer girl and at the same time with her disabled cop friend.  Not enough accidental things, he is even able to orchestrate a kind of rape game in a vacant industry hall at night, where programmer girl unknowingly meets a group of men who where made to believe she is meeting them for that rape role play. She doesn't know of course and despite being a very petite, untrained small woman she is not only able to escape all of them (unlikely) but even kills one of the with just one strike of a razor blade (very unlikely). Meanwhile Mr. serial killer goes on killing while the police... hm, well it seems he can just go around killing in Seoul, the CCTV extreme city, and not only not being caught, but not even being sought after. (very, very unlikely).it starts on dragging then, feeling like the creators couldn't decided what to do with the characters. All of a sudden our autistic programmer girl is obsessively in love with the serial killer, but we don't really get to know why that happens all of a sudden. The handicapped cop lad is out for revenge and instead of this time being wiser and getting backup when she wants to confront the serial killer, she - again - is dumb enough to be lured to a remote place, this time a whole vacant housing estate that is about to be demolished when she is there. And she really goes there alone again, with her wheelchair, into uneven demolishing ground, where this time she almost dies and is just being rescued the very last second. That was when I was annoyed because I thought how could someone with the police be that idiotic two times in a row? How did she even get to the police with that lack of intelligence in the first place? Anyways, it then gets more artsy and abysmal, serial killer killing, programmer girl acting like a 12-year old obsessively in love with him ignoring all sensibility, and in the end deciding to kill the killer. That, sadly, wasn't done in any realistic way.She still just has that small razor blade, and with it is able to make a slash through one eyeball, the nose including bone and the other eyeball. For this she would have neede something else, a mere small razor blade is not able to do that. But again, the creators wanted that effect of cut eyeballs, physics out the window. And again, no police while in a few weeks there are brutally murdered people everwhere and programmer girl happily celebrated with her friends. Conclusion: I did not know this was an adaption of a book and I do not know that book so I can't say if the adaption went well or not. As mentioned in the beginning, this was promising and it could have been rather good, but somewhere in the middle the creators somehow lost their own plot.  it got more and more confusing and the characters acting unlogical or plain dumb.Creating a good storyline with this content is probably comparably difficult, but the downward tendency was just too steep for me from the middle of the show."

The storyline is simple, and it's fast paced considering the episodes are just under 40 minutes each. The writers got right to the heart of this re-make. I've never seen the original, but from what I've gathered, this one has cut out a lot of filler and just given us the story of Lee Jae In and Kim Da Hyun's romance.

The actors did a fabulous job in their roles, and the main leads were on fire with the chemistry. There are lots of great kisses too! I found myself smiling a lot while watching this.

Yet, above all, the KDrama is a critical social study about relationship taboos and parental respect in South Korea as well as sexism in the workplace. Authentic. Bitter. Sweet.The original title of the KDrama ""Pretty Nuna, who invites me to dinner"" contains the taboo relationship with all its dynamics on which the story is based - the woman is older (nuna) than her boy friend (a no-go!)..., and still being a sucessful employee she earns good money instead of being married (another no-go).  Actually in South Korea this is a serious problem of a recent generation gap and gender conflict. Just consider the significance of ""Something in the Rain"" (as the romance that it is) in such a broader sense. If you are missing a special icing throughout the story, than this is simply what it is. It is supposed to. Overall, I consider ""Something in the Rain"" a rather up to date, down to earth, authentic romance, providing troubling insight what kind of circumstances South Korean women (and men) are facing these days.--------------------- SIDE NOTE --- South Korean women and romance in everyday day lifeIn relation to everyday life in South Korea the focus on romance and true love in KDrama takes on a whole new meaning. Very few people really have time for a relationship during their professional life. The working days are long. In addition, women are discriminated against at work, sexualized and reduced to their gender role. They work harder (and often more efficiently) than their male counterparts, but are paid less and are less likely to be promoted, as they are bound to get pregnant soon. If they really do get pregnant, then that's it for professional life. Child care for 70-80 workhour weeks (with commuting and company dinners) is hardly affordable. Women do not have to hope for flexible working hours from their employer. So women with children inevitably end up at the stove. Women can forget about returning to work.As a daughter, women already have a difficult time in the family. If they are married, then first of all they have to relieve the elders - in both families. (If they are not married, they are blamed or rushed oder pushed to quickly do so). Men, on the other hand, are celebrated by families as sons from the start. Accordingly, they present themselves in public with self-confidence and appear more macho. It's not uncommon for them to loudly and rudely gossip about the looks of women in the coffee shop or restaurant or shop or at work or in public. (Actually with the job market being extremely competitive, the appearance of women can not only decide about the partner, but also about the employment).There are numbers from surveys showing that on average, seven out of ten South Koreans don't have time to date and only about four out of ten are in a committed relationship. The work is more important. Not necessarily because they identify with it so much, but because they don't want to lose it. The pressure to perform is enormous for everyone. As a result, 3/4 of South Korean women between the ages of 25 and 29 are not yet married. Among women between the ages of 30 and 34, more than half are still unmarried. South Korean women also have increasingly modern demands for a self-determined life. They are less and less interested in macho men and suffocating family structures that reduce them to rasing children, representation and the home. This is also due to the fact that normal households can hardly cover their expenses. Family costs money. Divorce rates are rising (South Korea is having one of the highest in the world), yet women are finding it difficult to return to work. There is also a stigma to living as a single parent. (Accordingly, these days not only unmarried couples, but also married couples are less likely to have children.)Society is in a dilemma. In fact, it can't help but modernize its patriarchal, women-discriminating value systems if it wants to survive. The South Korean population will otherwise shrink under the given circumstances from 2027 onwards. (Update 30.7.22: Statistics Korea reports on 28. July 2022 first time shrinking in 2021 already...)"

Really enjoyed this, nicely paced and good ending.Detail:So i'll start by saying that my view on this might be different to others, not sure what the wider cloud-think is on this one because I haven't looked.  For me personally, this drama, and in particular Jung So Min's performance as Han Woo Joo resonated very deeply.  Someone close to me has similar symptoms to Woo Joo, she isn't BPD but it's amazing how similar some of the symptoms are and while Woo Joo's were perhaps more severe I've seen and recognise so much of it, seen how much it wrecks her inside also been with her as she got treatment and medication and is now no different to you and I.  So... I might be a bit biased on this one, and i'm fine with that!Jung So Min - someone i've always enjoyed watching, but this was definitely my favourite of her work, by far.Shin Ha Kyun takes on the role of the Doctor who befriends Woo Joo, starting by treating her and then it develops into something more.  If you're squeamish about older man, younger woman (in reality they're about 15 years apart) that might be a struggle for you.  Similarly, if you get hung up on the inappropriateness of doctor-patient relationships (which let's face it, are wrong for a reason) then, again, that might be a problem.  BUT I did feel that this was handled better then I was expecting and it wasn't glossed over.  If you can get over all that, it's all good from there.There's a lovely heart warming message throughout all of this about how we're not alone, we're all a bit broken, and we should embrace it. There are numerous other cases throughout, along with the ongoing storyline you have various new things happening in each episode and some of them progress through to others episodes.  Kim Dong Youg (Cha Dong Il) is only credited with one episode on MDL but actually is in several and another example of how characters go from being troubled to finding their feet and becoming everything they wanted to be.Lots of plotlines to keep you interested as the main stories develop.

I wondered if 50 episodes would make me give up but it had me hooked. I feel the production values were quite poor -you had to imagine 20 people  a riot of 20,000 or an army of 50 people  an army of 50,000 and the sets were all the same. However I found the twists and turns of the tale consistently gripping, they managed the development of the story over a long period from childhood friends to adults involved in the dangers and reversals of politics very well.  Also the clashes of romance between a love triangle. The good characters were not boring or lacking in character. The villains were suave and convincing and it was always intriguing to see just how they would manage politics and conflict and come out on top. The show broke down into two main political periods and the characters of the kings and their political ministers, wives, mistresses did get me emotionally involved - loving or admiring some, loathing others - to see how they would develop and what would happen to them. It was interesting how my views of them changed as they changed. The idea of showing where Joseon stood in relation to the great power China and how their kings tried to challenge China was interesting and convincing. The story around developing gunpowder as part of the power game and the involvement of the main characters in this was also a compelling  storyline. I especially liked the part of the story with the heroine cross-dressing and the brief parts in Japan. In conclusion , well recommended, do not be put off by the large number of episodes like I initially was. I liked the theme tune, though the other music became repetitive, this was not a major annoyance and no worse than most drama. I am not likely to re-watch it [or not soon anyway] but I am not letting this bring my score down. I cannot understand the low rating or some of the comments about this but as we say  10 men 10 colors.  If you like this kind of historical Korean drama, it is well worth staying the course.I found almost no parts that were really boring enough to make me miss my daily viewing of this saga and that is highly unusual for this mentally hyperactive guy. 11/10"

The things were all there to content everybody; yet everybody has the wrong thing.""- Ford Madox FordAnyone who has seen this drama, will recognize it is like walking down a dark hallway. You can't be certain exactly where you are at any given moment, and whenever there is any light, it gets obscured again by another piece of the puzzle. I have no doubt that the scriptwriter's work was sabotaged by the production crew, backstage politics, censorship, and other such soul destroying production elements. At its heart, this drama was meant to be about how women can't have everything they want, no matter what kind of person they are. It's a grim idea, which I don't personally subscribe to, but it is the overarching theme here.This series couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedic satire, or a grim and serious drama. It followed ""parasite"" in its unfounded disdain of the wealthy. The comic relief came in the form of an eccentric rapist character, a social climber, and an informer ""agent/ pimp"". All extremely dark characters, made lighter by their comedic aspects, much like in ""Parasite"". Our FL is introduced to us as an antagonist. She is a successful business woman who has never been in love. Her business is her baby. A baby she is forced to give up because she doesn't own the company, and she doesn't own the company because she is a woman. We are meant to equally dislike her because of her propensity for manipulation, and feel empathy for her on account of her traumatic life experiences and lack of love.The SFL has everything that the FL wants, or feels she is missing in life. The SFL wants what the FL has. The ML, will side with whatever woman he feels sorry for, as he is only attracted to women in distress, and as soon as a woman doesn't seem like a victim, he loses all interest in them. The ML has power, but is missing love, the SML has love, but wants power. The SML is made out to be a victim of the showbiz pimp character, even though he plainly agreed to and sought the help of the showbiz pimp in the first place.Therein lies the real problem with this drama. It doesn't know what it wants to say. It wants to be another ""Parasite"", about the rich being just as toxic as the poor, but in Parasite, the rich didn't do anything innately evil or wrong, whereas the poor were absolutely morally bankrupt, and blamed the rich for being so!The most boring characters are the static ""good"" victims. The rape victim/ crazy girlfriend, the little boy whose parents become too busy to be with him all day (fuck off, little boy), and the sister of the SML who needs to stop getting involved with her brother's life, and doesn't have a life if her own. The meek victim characters were so obnoxious, and the FL was the only one with enough backbone to tell them to fuck off, as she should. She even tells her younger brother, another victim character to fuck off by the end of the series.Through flashbacks, it is slowly revealed that all the main characters are victims of something. Some are victims of their own choices (like the SML and SFL), and some are victims of circumstances (like the FL and ML). Within the last two episodes, the story comes right off the rails entirely, so that it becomes absolutely ridiculous, in its ""ambiguous"" finale. Was the FL equal parts a victim and a perpetrator? Well, that seems to be the suggestion. She is revealed to be a Lady Macbeth character in relation to her brother. What a great character, wasted in a confused and rushed storyline. I hope to see more of this actress, and the actress that played the comic side character (David's ex-wife). I hope this isn't too strange of a comment, but, I couldn't take my eyes off the FL's mouth. I started to suspect she was wearing dentures, because she talks through her teeth. She doesn't open her mouth when she speaks, which, I'm just not used to seeing that, so it was very strange to me. It suited her character, with that closed armour, afraid of letting human emotion in or out. Anyway, I just couldn't help but make a comment about it. She's a beautiful woman, who was absolutely great in this!"

He really proved he was more than a pretty face in that drama. He blew me away with his acting. I started SPY expecting to see it again. Action, romance, drama and JaeJoong. I was super excited. Unfortunately, it never, ever delivered.

The story seemed like it would be action packed, what with the spy theme and all. It wasn't. Yeah, there was fighting and shooting in most of the episodes, but how it was managed to make them so boring and uninteresting is beyond me. I literally caught myself yawning more than once while I watched this drama.

The story is supposed to be suspeseful. I never found it so. I found it repetitive and extremely predictable from episode 1. There for a while, around ep 4 or 5, I did start hoping for it to pick up and get more interesting, which it seemed to do, but only barely and then it fizzled. Also, the ending was, again, predictable and anti-climatic.

Now, I rated this a 7, which means that I did find some good qualities to redeem it a bit. #1. JaeJoong. It's not his fault the writing sucked. While he was not at his Triangle caliber, he pulled his part off very well and his performance was more than decent. #2. The music. I really enjoyed the OST for this drama, especially Reuby's Key To Her Heart. It fit the theme well. #3. Short episodes. I liked how each episode was only about 45min. each. Any longer and it would have been even more drawn out.

I would only recommend this drama to other JaeJoong fans. Like I said, his acting is decent in this. However, if you are looking to watch a well written, suspenseful, action packed spy drama, you'd do well to skip this one."

It's true that humanity survives on greed and as they state, there is no greater calamity than greed. A man's greed is like a snake that wants to swallow an elephant. From the synopsis, this drama might look like a survival game to you, but it's much more than that. Somehow, despite it's message the drama is just mediocre. Watch it with a major TRIGGER WARNING, if you are sensitive to gore and dark elements. Squid game (Ojingeo) is an age old Korean game meant for kids where you have to play within marked boundaries with certain designated titles. You have to secure your title by hoping on one leg first and if you reach a certian point, you become the ""Royal Inspector"" who can use it's both legs.

Both of them are childhood friends who loved playing squid game with others kids. Both of them come across some kind of agents who trick them into a game where they can win a huge sum of money. Not knowing what exactly the game is, both of them choose to give it a try and land up in an unsual environment with 454 others among whom Ki Hoon is the last, i.e. 456.Lee Jung Jae and Park Hae Soo are master actors in the industry which everyone is aware of. Other than them there are plenty of familiar faces as well; Jung Ho Yun, Wi Ha Joon, Heo Sung Tae, Kim Joo Ryung, Oh Young Soo are those prominent actors. There is an Indian actor Anupam Tripathi in the main character too. Other than that there are 2 very big shots in the drama with 2-3 scenes so we can call that guest roles but trust me, they are 2 of the key characters in here. You won't find them in the cast list, just to be surprised watching the drama. So go ahead, haha. The games are quite intriguing if you have not watched likes of it (Liar Games, Alice on the Borderland, etc). I wonder why the screenwriter cum director Hwang Dong Hyuk took 10 years to complete this story. I mean this drama is nothing sort of very wow or anything. Judging from all the aspects, it's just mediocre. The drama fails to provide proper side stories for the main roles in order to back their characters well. Cinematography, which is very important for dark thrillers like this, was pretty beguile, hence keeping the viewer attached. The sound ending was apt for the mood and very suitable to the scenarios. The story progression is okay but becomes out of order or inconsistent at many points, especially the last 3 episodes. Some scenes were very firm and eye-catching but still......I think all the hype about this drama lies on the fact that people here die like mere insects and as we know violence and bloodlust are what people love the most, lol. The twists are pretty predictable, particularly when you're an avid Kdrama fan, it's pretty much easier to guess the major plots of it. The finale is very lousy. The games end in the beginning of the episode and becomes slow. The lame setup towards the ending, indicating for an another season, annoyed the shit outta me. The writer-director did a very poor job in that regard as well. Soooo....overally, SQUID GAME is an average one time watch. The ending is not exactly an open one, like we can just assume on our own but in another way you might expect one in case the production hints at it. Otherwise, there is no particular and firm necessity of another season. Sure there are few questions that they left unanswered but I can't be certain about another season."

First of all before saying why this drama didnt met up to many expectations of drama fans, its important to say that there were some genuinely intriguing aspects towards the show. One of the most apparent aspects of the drama was the international relationship between our Vietnamese female lead and aspiring reporter  Chi Mai ( Hong Yn Chibi) and South- Korean Hallyu Star JIN ( Sung Joon). Although it isnt out of the question for dramas to tackle international relationships or respectfully cast actors from different countries ( such as renowned South-Korean actor Lee Jong Suk being cast in the Chinese drama Jade Lover, or a young Lee Joon gis appearance in the Japanese movie with actress Aoi Miyazaki in Virgin Snow   ), it isnt a theme or relationship  which is often tackled or centralised in many typical  Asian dramas. Respectfully a lot of this can be to do with natural cultural differences and  language differences  between the two countries, and in My Secret Star there is  the evident problem of Chi Mai and JINs words being lost in translation  without Mais earphones which help to translate their conversations back and forth. On the other hand, My Secret Star was severely flawed by the aspect of story -writing and pacing. Although the show was very short, there was little to actually develop or process the relationship between our main leads. Undeniably  the main focus of the show was the supernatural element of JIN transforming into a young child when someone makes physical contact with him. In a typical cliche manner, JIN naturally discovers that he is immune to Chi Mais touch leading the two to spending more time together. This is certainly a sweet element to show within the portrayal of their relationship, however, after the few early episodes of My Secret Star, this supernatural element is nearly drawn out the picture entirely and by the ending of the drama, its magically  solved without rhyme nor reason .  It isnt necessarily that this aspect of the show shouldnt have been included, however, it was a strange move by the scriptwriters not to symbiotically use this as a  plot device  within portraying the development between the leads and challenges which allow them to grow closer  in later episodes. In addition to this  , despite JIN and Chi Mais status  as an international couple,  there were few  culture shocks or differences between the two leads  as well as general intrigue other one anothers country at all within the show. It is of course certainly not a necessary aspect to beat genuine romantic feelings, however, if a show is trying to tackle a relationship where both parties are from different countries and speak different languages, there is the natural element  of wanting to learn more about someones background. This is hardly shown in the drama and whilst JIN reveals a little bit and his past and resentments towards becoming famous, theres little explanation or actual drive as to why Chi Mai wanted to become a reporter even through revelations  of her childhood . Overall My Secret Star wasnt a show which was incredibly dire, however, poor story writing , characterisation , outfits ( particularly the Korean misrepresentation of the  gay fashionista  ) and an  inaccurate representation of international relationships, made the show incredibly cliche and a waste of time."

Start Up had great potential to be a good drama from its opening  episode. Aside from having the well-known talents of Bae Suzy, Nam Joo Hyuk  and Kim Seon Ho  as our main leads , the characters undeniably had the potential to be realistic and a breath of fresh air from the stereotypical cliches of romance dramas. Yet, story progression  and cliches truly provided to be Start-Up s own worst enemy, as Park Hye Runs screenwriting began to tackle oddly immature  themes in a show tackling adult characters  , plot inconsistencies, dire characterisation and straying away nearly entirely from the main focal point of making ones own way in the world in favour of lacklustre and poorly-written romance pairings. Perhaps the two characters  who were subject to the most injustice of characterisation and story writing in the drama are strikingly   the female lead Dal Mi ( Bae Suzy) and  Kim Seon Hos character Ji Pyeong. ( Although  Nam Joo Hyuks character Nam Do San must certainly be addressed later on as the elephant in the room.) In the beginning of the series, Dal Mi was an intriguing main character; a headstrong businesswoman with an intriguing backstory , stuck in a  rival relationship  with her sister and having a driving passion to succeed in the business world  . Then, not even several episodes later, Dal Mis characterisation from an independent businesswoman with actual depth, is subverted in order to allow  her to become the staid,  obsequious and often emotionally insecure   love interest of Do San and Ji Pyeongs affections.It is important to stress that isnt the case that  Dal Mi shouldnt have had a love interest or a relationship at all within the series.  A  strong female lead can still be well-written  as an individual(regardless of her relationship  status). Instead, it is rather how this drama portrayed the baffling and incoherent relationship between Dal Mi and Do San; a pairing which was to be expected and certainly wasnt entirely  bad between the characters as individuals  ( despite notable  biased feelings of some fans). Instead, it was rather how this pairing was built upon lies, deceit, insecurity, and emotional manipulation, which was often  glossed over in favour of  cutesy couple moments between Dal Mi and Do San as the storyline progressed. Dal-Mi became the typical trope of the  golden prize for the male lead, rather than an individual with her own thoughts and feelings; a sad destruction of an otherwise  intriguing character. This naturally moves us onto the second male lead of the series , Ji Pyeong, the  preferred love interest   of Dal Mi amongst watchers of the series. As an individual , however, it was not entirely the case that  Ji-Pyeong was a   badly-written character, but rather his scenarios seemed both unjustified and questionable over the duration of the drama. Initially appearing as a solipsistic, yet successful businessman, the series brings a lot to light about Ji-Pyeong as someone who is inwardly altruistic ; hardworking in order to have escaped the poverty of his childhood, a genuine supporter who sees the  potential  of Do Sans visions and who has  constantly admired Dal Mi since childhood ( a major driving force of the series, which is sadly never explored or touched upon after its initial use). Naturally, however, Ji-Pyeongs  selflessness often leads to his downfall and consequently because he undeniably puts up a deceitful guise in front of Dal-Mi , he naturally comes out with the short end of the stick by not  getting  the girl.   Nearly from episode one, it will remain apparent for viewers that Dal Mi and Ji-Pyeong have many striking similarities both within their pasts, careers, obstacles and even personality types. Yet despite the obvious pairing which would ultimately  arise between Dal-Mi and Do San,  these similarities between both characters were neither explored or developed  within  Start-Up. Yet relationships aside (and despite the obvious flaw of his  selflessness at times), Ji-Pyeongs altruism also plays  to his advantage within arguably  allowing him to become  the most emotionally-stable character of  Start-Up . He never truly takes out his feelings upon  the SST boys ( despite their  sarcastic comments ), Dal Mi  and maintains  professionalism in the workplace, by helping Do San ( even after Do San manipulates and physically punches him) against all odds, possibly making him the one true mature,  and unspoken hero of the entire drama . Next  it is important to address  the biggest elephant in the room, the main lead of  Start-Up,  Do San. Against all odds, Do-San  is a surprisingly interesting character , but a terribly-written individual  upon all grounds. He is initially introduced under  the archetype of the  loveable and lively dork- a profound genius, lacking in social skills, with a sanguine ambiance. Naturally, this allows people to gravitate towards Do-San such as  Dal-Mi as a love interest, and Ji Pyeong as a mentor . By default, Do-San should have been someone for viewers to root for; the underdog who becomes successful,  goes through a life-changing journey and revels at the end of the series with his  important  life-lessons in business, morality and love  . Instead the irony becomes apparent within Do-Sans friendly nature becoming a facade for his insecure and often fractious personality over the course of the drama . If Ji-Pyeong is the kind-hearted and selfless soul of the series, then Do-San is the egocentric opportunist  who plays Devils Advocate in the beginning of the series, before taking advantage of Ji-Pyeongs kindness through various methods of emotional and aggressive manipulation , even  punching him once because Dal-Mi was  upset. Upon this side note of Dal-Mi, it is crucial  to bring up  what is exactly problematic about Do -sans interactions and behaviour around the female lead. The main leads personality sometimes  verged upon what is commonly known in psychology as  covert narcissism.  Many of the notable traits of covert narcissism include imposter syndrome, subtle emotional manipulation, introversion and egocentric beliefs and wild fantasies over ones own success or goals - nearly all traits present within Do -Sans character . In addition to his obvious desire towards succeeding in the business sector ,  Do- Sans greatest fantasy soon manifests through his obsession with being Dal-Mi s  protector. This is not out of selflessness or as a consequence of  helping Ji-Pyeong to look after Dal-Mi,  but a dangerous daydream which soon grows into an unhealthy obsession to  protect her through emotional vanity and manipulation . Rather than being a symbiotic process of both characters coming to grasps with their flaws and learning to heal their emotional wounds, the  relationship between Dal-Mi and Do -San was simply uncomfortable and emotionally draining for viewers. In addition to this the second female lead Seo In Jae/Won In Jae(played by Kang Han Na),felt like a character limited only to an extended background character . In Jae could have easily  supported the pacing and depth of the storyline , giving viewers a break from the prolonged and cliche  love triangle dominating the show . She  had a  surprisingly decent backstory and certainly potentially interesting  character depth,  that could have been explored in episodes focusing on her rekindled   relationship   with Dal Mi.Ultimately, however, In Jae was pushed out of the way in favour of the lacklustre paring between Do San and Dal Min; a crying shame, for a character with wasted potential . Overall, Start-Up  does tackle some  intriguing dynamics of the business world, family and a  dramatic  love triangle. However, writer Park Hye Ryun did not do justice with this  series- characters were often   poorly-written or lacked intrinsic depth, the second-half became overly reliant upon immature cliches , tropes and plot holes to  prop-up the sloping storyline, and  the main pairing was unhealthily built upon emotional gaslighting and insecurity, rather than sincere  feelings and learning to overcome these problems symbiotically . Certainly not worth investing time within if youre looking for a well-written drama ."

There are plot holes and cliches and tonal whiplash, and the show requires a high level of suspension of disbelief, but it's also fun and wacky and doesn't take itself too seriously and I thoroughly enjoyed myself even if I didn't really care about the plot at all. The overarching message about the importance of history (and who it belongs to) is compelling and timely and I loved that, for all the comedic moments, the show never forgot about its core theme. The whole cast is great but Joo Won is especially endearing as both the bumbling Hwang Dae Myung and incredibly cool and slick Skunk, and Choi Hwa-Jung is an absolute delight as Dae Myung's partner in crime and I would totally watch a prequel series all about her backstory because the brief montage we got was not nearly enough.

In these cartoons Dora used to go around on her kiddy-sized expeditions (mainly in her backyard or the neighborhood park) and discover new things.However, despite being known as an excellent kid explorer, Dora wasnt the brightest bulb in the closet. Every episode went something quite like this; Dora would stand in front of, say, an apple tree and the treasure that she sought after would be an apple. So in order to find that apple, Dora would first cluelessly look to one side then the other, then shed look all over all the while conveniently missing the tree located right behind her. After a good ten minutes of looking, when Dora still wouldnt find the darned apple, the creators of the show would decide to give her a hint.The hint went something like this: Dora, if you look exactly behind yourself, youll find something. Now, we are not telling what it is, since this is only a hint but I think you should look behind you and see what you find. For further help, a huge green arrow would point towards the apple on the tree. That was when Dora would finally have a light bulb moment and discover the goal of her expedition. Feeling mighty proud of her feat, she would then ask the viewers whether they too were able to find the apple or not. Even as a child, I was about ready to combust at this point, for I had found the mighty apple the moment the tree came into the view. However, despite all its flaws it was still one of my favorite cartoons because it made me feel so clever. I was smarter than Dora. The world was a good place. What could possibly go wrong?Except, when the same Dora-style execution is done in Contemporary Crime Shows, things do actually go wrong. This is exactly one of the reasons why people love Stranger so much.Stranger doesnt come with the usual BS. It doesnt assume that its viewers are mentally impaired baboons who cant put two and two together. It actually respects the audience by considering them smart enough to follow the plot. There is no spoon feeding here, nor does a big ass green arrow point towards every idiotic discovery ever made. Instead, its a drama with an intelligent script that demands your full attention. Every scene and every character has a reason for existing. With brilliant direction and almost no plot-holes the drama not only succeeds in captivating the audience, rather it also gives them space to really think about all that is happening.For a lot of actors a cold and emotionless role is the gateway for slacking. They leave all their acting skills in the backseat and decide that posing like a cringey af model throughout the show is the way to go. Jo Seung Woo with his Prosecutor Hwang Shi Mwok explains that kids, it is indeed not the way to go.For a character that is supposed to be expressionless and indifferent to everything and anything, Seung Woo sure did put out the acting of the century. While his face remains carefully blank at all times, there are slight nuances in his expression that highlight the emotional development Shi Mwok experiences throughout the episodes. A slight twitch of the brow to show frustration, relaxation of the facial muscles to show ease and the gorgeous, beautiful and rare smile to show happiness. Simply put, Shi Mwok is a delight to watch. Without showing, he still shows so much that by the first half of the drama, the viewers have already formed a deep connection with him.A lot of people thought that the whole brain surgery plot-line was unnecessary, however, I think it was wholly essential in order for Shi Mwok to become who he was. He was a prosecutor who was able to observe every crime scene with a cold detachment that is unachievable for a normal person. And the show facilitated the fact by backing it up with a genuine reason instead of feeding the viewers some bogus and over-dramatic crap.For all those people who have seen Gods Gift, I know that Seung Woo shocked your pants off. The utter versatility of the actor cannot be described in words. He was a completely different person in this show, simply unrecognizable and for that, he has all of my respect.I think one of the most endearing characters in the show was our female lead Han Yeo Jin. Bae Do Na held her own in terms of acting and the amount of chill that her character had was unlimited. She was such a genuinely cool person. Relentless, strong and quirky. Even though she won against bad people numerous of times, there was never any pomposity in her, for to her, even the wins felt like failures because they were against her own people. You can see how her heart hurt at the name of injustice and how fully determined she was to stand against it. No matter the consequences. She was the kind of fearless cop that is every ordinary citizens dream and every corrupt person in powers nightmare.So considering how exquisite these two were individually, its no surprise that they were unbeatable together. Lieutenant Han and Prosecutor Hwang: The ultimate dynamic duo that made the baddies shiver in their boots. The chemistry between them was excellent; easily topping many romances. They were the kind of comrades that can lean on each other in time of need, rely on the other in time of action and above all, understand each other all the time. As weird Shi Mwok was, Lieutenant Han just seemed to get him and he in turn respected and shared his secrets with her.With best friends like these, who needs romance?All of the other side characters came with their own quirks. They had their own story, their own motives behind actions that appeared to be ruthless and their own flaws and weaknesses. Nobody was completely good or completely bad; rather they were all wholly mortal.Like other crime shows, the show did not make use of convenient plot-lines or shock value. There werent any WTF moments or nerve-wracking cliff hangers, rather there was a constant under-current of gravity that kept the viewers rooted to their spot.This is the kind of drama that will warm your heart, fill you with sadness at the worlds corruption and leave you with the sweet hope that not all people are wicked, that there is still some good left and that little bit of goodness might just be able to overcome the evil.I know that I should just end this review here but I need to be completely honest. As as you can clearly see, I have nothing but good things to say about this show. However, it doesn't mean that I am going to give it a perfect rating like many others because despite all of its beauty there were times where I wanted something more. I wanted to know why Mwok Shi was so relentless on eradicating all corruption. If he couldn't feel anything, where did all his righteousness sprout from? I wanted to know more about Lieutenant Han's background. Why was she always so alone?Even though the whole drama came with a certain amount of simplicity and subtle intelligence, the last few episodes did at moments take on a fairy-tale touch. The conclusion was everything that you could've wanted, it was the perfect ending. However, considering the somber tone of the show, personally I expected something more gritty and raw. So while this was one of the more amazing shows I have watched, I will not claim that ""This was the best Korean drama ever made"".That being said, with some of the best dialogues and a spot-less execution, this drama is definitely not one to be missed. Which is why I wholeheartedly recommend it to every crime/thriller fan out there.Enjoy!"

Season 2 of Stranger follows the journey of Prosecutor Hwang Shi Mwok and Superintendent Han Yeo Jin in their relentless persuit of the truth even when everyone around them seems hella shady.If you don't remember season 1 at all, I suggest you give it a rewatch before going into this or else find a friend who is a MASSIVE stranger fan to run you through the past events like I did. Why? Because, even though S2 follows a whole new storyline, the characters are the same. There are no re-introductions as their personalities have already been established in the previous season. And this season deals with the aftermath of a lot of things that went down in the past.I, for one watched it 3 years after finishing the first season and because of my goldfish memory, I remembered absolutely nothing. Despite that, however, the story hooked me in and kept me with it throughout. Stranger 2 is less action focused and takes more of a philosophical note for the most part. It's a critique on the system that runs a country. It shows how power is exploited. How the media, the prosecution, the police and the conglomerates influence the very foundation of a nation and yet there is always some conflict of interest between them.The story starts with a battle between the police and prosecution as they debate over investigative rights. A lot of dirty politics is involved as both the sides try to one up each other. From there on it branches out to multiple plotlines as more and more cases, mysteries and problems come to light. Nothing is handed to you on a plate. The drama gives you a serious mental workout as it forces you to pay attention to everything. Slowly but surely, all the various plotlines come together to meet and punctuate the overall message with multiple punches.The show, like its predecessor does not bank on thrill or 'the next big moment' instead it takes its time, moving with this undercurrent of tension you can't look away from. All along, you feel like something important is happening and you just can't miss it even when there are no huge developments. The beauty of it is that nothing that's happening is stupid. This is not a show that is trying to pretend to be complicated and fool viewers into thinking it's smart with lazy writing. It's actually fucking smart with zero plotholes as the story flows smoothly, connecting all dots as episodes progress. And it hits home beautifully as the final episodes approach and the intensity skyrockets.However, I will say that this is not reccomended for those who like their shows easy to digest. Who don't like heavy dialogues and aren't fans of politics, debates and philosophical questions. 'Cause there is a LOT of that stuff. To the point that I actually felt productive after watching each episode. I felt my mind broaden and working overtime and I absolutely loved every second of it.Ofcourse, with a show like this the biggest danger is of it going in the direction where it becomes clinical, preachy, dry and boring. And that's where the drama wins by using small but extremely powerful interactions between characters that does wonders to humanize everything and make you emotionally connect with these people.Shi Mwok, our emotionally stunted prosecuter is so clueless and indifferent about feelings that it's simply hilarious and adorable. Han Yeo Jin, with her quirky personality and chill as fuck persona is extremely endearing.We saw the camaraderie between them in season 1 and that was one of the major selling points of the show. But, in this one, for the majority of the drama our duo stands on opposite sides confronting each other and you feel rather starved for their interaction. So when it happens, it's all the more impactful. With incredible small gestures and tiny moments they show how they care for each other. How she's still his best friend. How they are the ultimate team. How she's the only one he feels comfortable around and how they just seem to get each other. And it's absolutely glorious.These two are badass in a very real sense. There's no posturing or camera effects or cheesy dialogues/action scenes that make their badassery known. It's the effortless good in them and their dogged pursuit of what's right, realization of their own mistakes and unimaginable strength that wins your heart. It also helps that both the main leads have extremely natural and nuanced acting. Bae Doo Na and Jo Seung Woo just killed it. With the latter blowing your mind with the subtlety of his expressions and the former making you invested by the transparency of her emotions. The season also explores a plethora of other characters, with their own motivations and personalities that are extremely well developed. Strong women in power. Morally grey characters who come through deliciously. The acting is outstanding across the board and the soundtrack is phenomenal. You think the OST (an instrumental with no lyrics) is nothing special? Wait till it makes the simple act of two people talking business in an office, the most thrilling thing to ever happen to you. Simply stunning.The show also has one of the most beautiful endings I have ever seen. It's so full of hope and warmth that it made me cry. Even as it highlights the never ending corruption, the ugly politics that makes one feel that their country is too far gone to make a change, Stranger comforts and shows what it could be. How, in these murky waters, being true to yourself is the real power because it gives you dignity, confidence and most importantly, peace.So all in all, I'll say that while Stranger 1 is kinda like everyone's cuppa tea as a crime/thriller, Stranger 2 is definitely an acquired taste. It's still excellent though and completely unique in its genre with masterful execution. Hopefully, some news of a 3rd season will come to save all of our souls soon enough.So hey, if you wanna leave the mainstream behind, feel a little bit smarter after every episode and question everything you know about the system, then this show is your go-to!"

I enjoyed the series over all. I was a bit frustrated with the ending and felt like there was an opportunity to be a positive impact and that was foregone in exchange for a more realistic take. Let's break down what I enjoyed and what I didn't. Spoilers for 'The Bad'.The Good:- The chemistry between the leads is excellent.- Both the lead characters are great on their own.- The revelation of the issues they both had as people was quite realistic and eye-opening on how you could be perceived.- The second couple were great too. Also very realistic because they were complete opposites but they made positive changes in order to be together.- Realistic issues that are common in real life but not usually depicted in dramas.The Bad:- Both the leads had annoying mothers and long-standing issues with them which was resolved ridiculously fast but the main leads couldn't resolve theirs?- The fact that a misunderstanding led to the problem and it was never discussed. Is that realistic? Yes. But it is frustrating nonetheless.- The male lead was taking positive steps but they still left it as is.I wouldn't mind if the show ended with them separating because they were at an impasse but not when there was a misunderstanding that caused the break-up and the male lead was making positive strides in order to overcome his avoidant presonality. It felt like a disservice towards a loving couple.It's still entertaining. It's a different kind of an ending than the usual. It's watchable if you are willing to have an open mind and accept in not all endings are happy."

The guys in the gym were meant for comic relief, because bullying can be a heavy topic. ??? ???? This tackled a serious issue in schools but in an easier-to-handle comedy, rather than a dark, gritty way. ?????I thought that not seeking revenge was a valuable lesson. His motive to win was for the female lead's sake. It also showed how important it is to overcome our fear of others. A bully is rendered powerless when victims get past their fear. ??"

This story tried to be too much. It was a romance mixed with slapstick humor, and dark thriller. How did those elements combine? Not too well, actually....but the parts that were good were good enough to keep me watching until the end. This show started off strong and I was loving it up until about a little over halfway, when it dawned on me that the story was just kind of nonsense. But the leads are so freaking adorable (and probably every teenage girl's dream fantasy romance) that they kept sucking me back in every week. I think Park Bo Young may have reached 'girl crush'status for me. And Park Hyung Shik is almost too pretty - but his acting as Ahn Min Hyuk crushing on Do Bong Soon --- I just ""can't even"" with him. Too cute for words. They were so cheesy together, but this ahjumma was eating it up. Seriously....this romance is what the show has going for it. But even that is unrealistically done. This show is just fluff....lots and lots of fluff. The story line is chaotic. There is an evil villain that is just too horrifying to be in a rom-com. It was very jarring to go from sweet romance scenes to a creepy masked kidnapper who is terrorizing young women. And the slapstick antics of the gangsters and the high-school gangsters and the screechy femme planning team leader was funny the first time but became just useless filler that was pretty annoying fast forward material. And a lot of people hated that, although played for laughs, the mom seemed abusive (may be why the writers tried to explain that one away in the final episode.) There were funny parts, sure, but they overplayed their hand with them quite a bit. The only thing I would rewatch in this show is the moments with Min Hyuk and Bong Soon. Would I recommend it....sort of. I mean, you'd have to know going in that the story makes no sense, but as a backdrop for a super cute, cheesy beyond belief romance...if you can deal with that then, yeah, go for it. I was entertained for sure (otherwise the rating would be like a 4). But if you need a plot that is logical and a more 'mature' (not THAT kind of mature, but more grown up) romance, then this one won't be right for you."

Whilst standing up for herself after gang members bully her, she finds herself approached by Ahn Min Hyuk, the handsome and somewhat childish CEO of Ainsoft, a gaming company. Ahn Min Hyuk, who holds a great distrust towards the police, witnessed the whole exchange of Bong Soon's superhuman strength, and now wants to employ her as a bodyguard after being threatened by an unknown enemy. Min Hyuk falls in love with super-strong Bong Soon at first sight, but there's a catch. Bong Soon has eyes for someone else; a police officer and childhood friend, In Guk Doo, whom she has known since high school.
When chaos ensues after a series of kidnappings in Do Bong Soon's hometown of Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu, Bong Soon must decide whether to use her strength and stand up to evil, or play it safe and keep her powers hidden from the world. Combined with the love triangle she faces between In Guk Doo and Ahn Min Hyuk, as well as having to keep Min Hyuk safe, Bong Soon's life is thrown into turmoil.

Go Kyung-pyo (Kung-soo) and Chae Soo-bin (Dan-ah) played their parts well, but the script fell short, mostly because of how irritating and unlikeable the character of Dan-ah was.  I did, however, love the character of Kung-soo.  I was impressed by his strong feeling of right and wrong.  I also loved the community he built with all the drivers he'd worked with over the years.  That was the strong point of this show, the friendships.  The demonstration of how people that are enemies can become friends, how friendships remain even after your geography changes.  It was a testament to Kung-soo that he had all the friends he had, because he was genuinely a good and nice person.Dan-ah was kind of the polar opposite.  She was not a nice person, and because of that, didn't really have friends.  Everyone was either in awe of her or feared her.  She apparently was never taught to use her words, because she is forever hitting or kicking someone, which sometimes worked for the sake of comedy, but certainly didn't endear her to me.The ending tied things up neatly but wasn't especially memorable."

So in my opinion I'm not exaggerating, lol.I saw the US preview when it first aired but never watched the series because here in the US shows have a tendency of getting canned right off the block and I didn't want to get hooked if that happened. When I saw on each Korean episode that this was loosely based off the American version I went to check and was surprised to see that US version actually lasted for 9 seasons. So with that being said I can't compare the two because I've only watched the Korean version.I fairly enjoyed each and every episode and all of the cast members except the true antagonist who came into the series midway through. I won't lower my rating even though the series took a different turn from from episode 5 and on and how the antagonist was thrown in. I think his character was just thrown in just to stretch out the series.Every episode had me grinning from ear to ear and the last two had me fighting back some tears. I love love love dramas that have the capability of getting every last emotion out of me. I was a bit bummed because it stated it had action in it but sadly enough there was no action in none of the episodes. Before anybody disagrees, my definition of action is fighting scenes, car chases, that sort of thing but I guess some of these dramas that state action means someone doing something.I also loved the two male lead's chemistry. To me it was like the best father and son duo ever. I love how Koreans can get along with each other without worrying about age differences.As usual I always comment on the last episode because to me that brings closure to the whole series if it's done right. I can't complain about how it ended as oppose to the other endings of drama series I've watched. I wanted a tiny bit more of justice being served but I had to take what I can get.All in all, this was a good series to watch for me."

The ending episode was meandering and pointless, honestly. It had a happy ending, but was lackluster and bland. I think that if they had cut this show to 16/32 episodes instead of 20/40, they could have written a tighter story. There were some things that got lost in the story, some things that were never explained, and some things that dragged on way too long. The romance sizzled in the beginning and then flickered and died, and then when it rekindled, it was barely an ember. One thing that some people liked, but kind of annoyed me was the lighting in the show. Every time the main characters were about to have a real kiss - there was always this bright light shining between them. I guess it was supposed to be artistic? Once would have been plenty for that and it might have been ok, but it happened at least 3 or 4 times. 

Most of the actors did a good job. Ji Chang Wook and Nam Ji Hyun are both fantastic actors and I love to watch the play of emotions on JCW's face. NJH is so earnest and sincere in her acting. Choi Tae Joon as Eun Hyuk was such a cutie pie and his awkwardness and his boyish charm and enthusiasm were fun to watch (this was my first show with him.) I wasn't really impressed with Nara or her character. She was bland and we didn't learn much about her. I thought Kim Ye Won was a scene stealer though! KYW as Ji Hye started off as an unlikable bully and a cheater, but she quickly became one of my favorite supporting actors in this show, and I kind of wished she had been the second female lead instead. I loved her snarky comebacks to Yoo Jung - she made me laugh a lot. And Dong Ha, as the villain Hyun Soo, did an amazing job. It's the first time I've seen him in anything that I recall, but he nailed his role. 

The music was decent, nothing stand out, but appropriate. 

I won't re-watch this. It was ok, but not one of the best I've seen. I think the longer run time severely hurt the pacing."

Also, the whole Chinese/Korean language thing threw me off? at first since it is my first time watching a cross language drama but after a while you kind of get used to it, either that or you get annoyed by it.

If you are looking for a short drama to experiment with because you've got nothing else you would rather watch at the moment then go for it. It wasn't a bad drama but it wasn't the greatest one either, all in it's watchable. It has funny moments, some slightly sad or rather emotional ones and some awkward moments but it's not totally shabby.

The music was very repetitive and I didn't really care much for it for some reason so I don't really remember it. If it doesn't stick, I won't remember it.

The ending fell kind of short to my expectations and it left quite a bit unsaid, I wish the ending would have been wrapped up nicer.

Overall it's an ok watch  and I don't regret watching it but I wouldn't necessarily re-watch it."

His quiet life is soon disturbed by strange incidents that start occurring in his apartment, and throughout Korea. As people start to turn into monsters, Hyun Soo and the other residents try to survive.","Go Min Si, Go Youn Jung, Kim Gab Soo, Kim Nam Hee, Kim Sang Ho, Lee Do Hyun, Lee Jin Wook, Lee Si Young, Park Gyu Young, Song Kang",Netflix,"Surprisingly hopeful and at times heartwarming tone for a show full of monsters and death.The show is more action and the characters/relationships driven compared to my initial assumption of it focusing on the story itself. The plot is quite simple: people turn into monsters, humanity has to survive, but in the midst of it, Sweet Home asks one important question ""What does it mean to be human?"" and explores it throughout all the episodes. It shows the best and the worst side of humanity - the will to survive that can unite or turn people against each other; the will to be humane as a way of fighting against the circumstances, but also using the horrifying situation as an excuse to abandon empathy.Despite the show claiming to be in line with thriller, horror and psychological genres, it falls closer to action as a leading one. The plot might seem simple, but it did an amazing job connecting the dots slowly presented. Quite a few times in the 2nd half I recognized the continuation of the plots and hints dropped in the beginning episodes. While the main question might not be answered and the ending could seem disappointing and unsatisfying for some, I found it to be the best possible approach. Any other take would fall short and seem forced. It definitely leaves a lot of room for possible season two, but lack of continuation of the story would not make me angry either.We are introduced to a brilliant cast of characters, that all have different stories to tell, that will resonate with the audience. In a short period of 10 episodes, I've got to see well built character development not only for Cha Hyun Soo, but also for many side characters. While I strongly disagreed with many of the character's decisions and behaviors, at the same time I could understand their reasoning behind it. If I had to pick my favorite characters (beside the star of the show Hyun Soo) I would pick empathetic Yoon Ji Su, brave Jung Jae Heon, resourceful Han Du Sik and level-headed Lee Eun Hyuk. That said, the chemistry between the whole cast was out of this world and they played off of each other well.The wise advice I could give to anyone before starting: don't expect dark psychological horror. Even though the show explores quite a few psychological themes, as I mentioned before, it leans more towards action in addition to some dark humor, especially in the beginning episodes. That said, the thing it has to be applauded for - the stakes were real. You know the shows, where you feel close to nothing when characters are in danger because you know they will survive anyway? Not here. Each problem presented to them, each encounter with monsters, each turn made me tense, scared, but also excited for what's to come.I'm not exactly one to pay attention to music in movies or shows, unless it truly catches my attention. Here, all the songs were extremely fitting and perfectly supported scenes they were played in. At first some choices might feel out of place, but as the drama progresses it starts to feel like a deliberate choice that somehow works. If I had to complain about anything, I'd say I was not the biggest fan of the CGI monsters at first. Since I was expecting a dark psychological horror like Strangers From Hell, the cartoon-ish like models with questionable motion put me off. The moment I accepted this is not what I signed up for and started to enjoy the action, I started to appreciate the design of the creatures. Some had comical features (we see an a*s once), but it balanced well the dreadful emotional moments happening among the characters.What's more, in the beginning episode the plot was not presented in a linear way, so it might be confusing. Later on the time jumps are barely happening and it's easier to follow the story.In conclusion: I cried a lot. I got attached to each and every character. I cared for what's going to happen to them. I was curious about their past stories and how they affect their current decisions and actions. The show simply made me engage in whatever was happening on the screen, to the point of me binge watching it for 10 hours and forgetting to eat.Warning: there is a lot of blood, some gore, story about child abuse and one for severe bullying. It talks about suicide and self harm. These themes might be too much for some viewers, so feel warned before giving it a shot."

What this drama had going for it was the melodrama. Sure, there is the big trop with the lost daughter and the big company, but they kept everything melodramatic, somehow, till the ending. And the whole drama was actually entertaining. Also, Lee Jae Joon is in it (enough said).However, most of the characters, but especially the ladies, were annoying till the very end. The sister was hard core evil and she hated everyone, being all spoiled, but at least her behavior can be understood as she feels like everything is being taken from her because of her sister. But you can't really explain the others' situation. The father, even though he seemed nice and sweet, he was no better. Even though Bom, the leading lady, had helped him when he had nothing, he didn't even let her explain herself or give her a chance, no, he kicked her out of the house. And that is not even the worse part. No, no no, after finding out that she is his daughter and she lives with them, he blames him for his family's situation and asks her to move out. Her mother had a slip too, but overall she was okay. But then, there were the granny and her daughter. The daughter kept supporting everyone else other than Bom. And, she took advantage of her sister in law and then pretended to be all moral and everything when it came to Bom. And the granny, she not only hated Maru, she also kept putting Bom down over and over to the point that she had to live her own house. Her dad's younger daughter was annoying too, as she hated Bom, for no reason at all. Finally, Bom's ""step mom"" was pretty much evil at first, but then she decided that she  loved Bom as a daughter. So, she actually turned to be a good character after all. Her romance was cute too. Also, the main couple's romance was adorable too. And Bom, her ex sister and maybe her uncle, were likable.So, overall, seven out of ten, because the story was good, but the characters were annoying and there was zero OST."

The premise of the show is borderline offensive. The scene where a guy pretending to be gay lectures, actual gay man on gay rights and coming out made me want to dig a hole and bury myself alive.Its obviously a straight story, but they were pushing the gay love line so bad. The scenes between ML and SL were more romantic and shot in a more typical for romance way than the ones between the actual main couple. As if they wanted brownie points for being progressive, but they were not willing to actually give us a gay couple, just bait us with stuff like we had here.So, lets talk about the characters, because there is quite a lot to unpack.Park Jin Sung is a disaster of a character. I love me some flawed ones, but he had no redeeming qualities. While I can empathize with his initial decision to join the pilot episode of the show to get money for his dads surgery, the fact he kept going with this lie later on was laughable. Why? His reasoning for not dropping the show was: it will hurt my crush. What was in the brain of that dude? He became so amazingly preachy, I wanted to teleport myself into a drama and slap him at least a few times. This whole mess happened, because he did not think about anyone else except what Ah Jin thought and felt. Whats even more frustrating? He didnt really lose anything in the end. He got his happy ending and we didn't see that much backlash happen directed at him. None of the characters were even that angry with him. Karma aint real here \_()_/Kim Ah Jin well. I like to think there are two types of naive female leads - nice naive and dumb naive. She is the latter one. When people questioned her on the reasons for the gay chef show, she had no real answer. She said she wanted to show how gay people are normal and not different than others, but thats dumb, since the main focus of the show and its promotion was that its a GAY chef as if this was the most important description of him as a human being. She had NO IDEA what she was producing. It shows when she gets so amazingly shocked about these 3 people protesting and asking for the cancellation of the show. Their eyes were full of hatred YES HONEY, THERE ARE HOMOPHOBIC PEOPLE. As someone who was willing to make a whole show focused on the fact your host is gay, you should do some research to know what you are getting yourself and said person into. So you can prepare. So when homophobes show up, no one needs to protect you and make you feel better. Its you who should stand strong and defend your host and the program you are creating. Her whole character was so amazingly useless and no true development happened.Luckily we were graced with Kang Tae Wan, the true star of the show. First, I want to say Lee Hak Joo is an amazing actor and I believed every line he delivered. When he was happy, I was giggling like an idiot, when he was sad I wanted to fight whomever made him sad. Thanks to that awesome performance I was able to engage in his part of the story more. I also appreciate that they avoided going with stereotypes and making the gay character less manly with over exaggerated movements, way of speaking and fashion. Tae Wan was none of that. I loved to watch his emotional journey and how he slowly learned how to smile and get close to people around him. I loved the closure he was given and his scene with the dad in the last episode.The plot had so much potential and could have offered us so much, but for some strange reason they decided to not do it. Why did they give us the typical side couple? They could use that time to explore Park Jin Woos character more. Deliver more scenes of Park Jin Sung cooking while they film the show, with some nice messages and calming mood. Dive deep into the struggles of LGBT community. Let Jin Sung taste it a bit, so when he finds out Tae Wan is actually gay, it would truly hit him how much of a bullshit what he did was. Truth to be told, the whole 12 episodes felt like a beginning of the drama, just an introduction. What happened to the characters development? We only got Tae Wan opening to people a bit and Gyu Jang being slightly less of an asshole. Thats it. Not to mention the random journalist which was used in the show two times, when the plot needed it. They should simply incorporate him more into the plot. Otherwise, him being so invested when we saw him only twice makes no sense. Then there is the last episode. They legit got the main couple to break up 20 minutes before the ending, then we jumped to the future and the last scene they met again wow. hOw oRiGiNaL! In the last scene, I was hoping we will get all three main characters live their lives and move on, taking different paths and not seeing each other anymore. With that I would consider giving it 7.That said, I might have disliked the story, but I truly liked the directing. How at times the camera focused on smaller details and not the faces of the actors as they were talking about emotional topics. Or when the screen turned to black as the important lines were delivered. This allowed me to truly focus on what was being said and how it was being said. How the whole drama was not overly produced and had this cozy feel to it. Not to mention that bop of ost. Need it all on my laptop asap.Overall, I would truly not recommend watching. Sure, Tae Wan was amazing, but the amount of frustration I had to deal with as I was watching the rest of the characters was unimaginable. If you decide to watch it, dont get invested in any character in hopes of seeing them improve and have some nice development - it aint gonna happen."

The start was really good and strong, with an intense case for revenge and a smooth love triangle. The family drama was also sweet and warm. However, the rest of the revenge cases weren't as strong and were kind of boring. The friendship and family storylines were okay, but not enough to keep everything smooth and interesting till the very ending. The love triangle got boring as well. The actual love story was, in fact, predictable and kind of tiring too. Also, as it happened in the first season, there wasn't a clear explanation as to who was behind the revenge app.However, there were some nice moments to it.

I mean...girl falls for her stepfather?? Say what? But as you get into the story, you'll be telling people...""but it's not really LIKE that!"" I don't want to give away the plot, but it's not as icky as the summary makes it sound at ALL.

I was drawn to this show and only gave it a chance because of Kim Young Kwang. He won me over in Go Ho's Starry Night, and I needed to see something else he was in. Luckily for me, this show was starting just about the same time as I finished the other. For me, he was the best thing about this show. I think that I would have dropped it completely about 3/4 of the way through if it had not been for his cute little smiles and Nan Gil's ""heart eyes"" for Na Ri. Soo Ae's acting didn't blow me away, but she wasn't horrible. Lee Soo Hyuk plays the second lead, and as always plays so aloof that it's hard to get a read on him. Jo Bo Ah as Yeo Joo was easy to hate at first, but she grew on me. However, I read that several were just annoyed by her altogether. The bad part is that the writers sort of just forgot to give her a reason to even be in the story after the first few episodes. It really felt like she was tacked on to the rest of the group with no real reason to even be in their midst any longer. She just kept showing up for no explainable reason. 

The writers also set up a way more interesting story than we received in the end. It started off fairly strong and then sort of petered out as it wore on. I wouldn't re-watch this and I would only recommend it to KYK fans if you just REALLY need to watch him in something. I was pretty disappointed in how this one played out."

I'm glad she followed her dreams and I know how scary it must've been for her, especially when her parents told her to come home in the early days. However, she came out on top and made her parents proud with a very unique performance in the heart of Seoul. I just loved, like loved every single performance. From Toy's performance, reading all their letters, Somi's playing of melodica, Du-na's story, to the crowd's sigh of relief when ""Is it Still Beautiful?"" starts to play. He definitely fooled me, I thought he was going to sing at first, I thought ""He has to!"", but then he didn't, but at last he surprised me! I'm so glad he decided to sing, and even better to sing with whole crowd!!Jo sumi's performance was really beautiful. She has an amazing voice and it's no surprise she's one of the best singers in the world. Very creative performance and they definitely made it work. It was really funny watching her doll-like performance and quite commendable as I can't imagine how she managed to sing while being that tense. Just goes to show how skillful of a singer and performer she is! Watching the parents, children and fellow, aspiring singers watching the performance was inspiring and heartwarming to see. I am quite familiar with AKMU, as I'm a big YG stan especially being a BLINK, it's automatic to know all the other artists within the company. Extremely talented siblings and I just love the relationship between Su-hyun and Chan-hyuk. Their bickering is too cute and funny that I always laugh whenever they argue, but there wasn't too much of it here, but still it's always a treat to see how professional they are as well. I got to know AKMU a lot and I have become a fan if I wasn't already. I'm sure if Chan-hyuk had more time he would've come up with an even more insane of an idea, that's how ambitious he is, and he made it work in Take 1, along with his sister, Su-hyun. I love both of them, and NAKKA's an amazing song  go listen to it. That performance was really mind-blowing, everything was perfect, they truly nailed it! That Take 1 was made for Nakka.I cried a lot during Take 1, but I must say Yim Jae-beoms comeback made me tearful. Even as I'm writing this I'm reminiscing about his performance on the rooftop and how emotional it was. I never knew who he was, but I'm very happy that he is back, at least doing none other than Take 1 performance, respect. I can't imagine what he was going through with such a loss. I can definitely understand his depression throughout the years, but I just want to let him know that he's doing great and that he is amazing. He has inspired so many and it shows, and I hope the best for him and his daughter.Rain's performance was really cool, I loved it and what better song to pick than Rainism, right? I was hoping he was going to pick Rainism, it's such a timeless song, just gets better the more you listen to it. Now, imagine a huge performance like this for Rainism. Well... you' don't need to, because Rain made it happen! Rain is a role-model and in Take 1 it shows how hardworking he is. My favourite quote from his performance was: ""Treat the practice like the real thing, and the real thing like practice!"" I'm also glad he decided to do one more song, and I through it I have gotten to know Rain more and I'm definitely a fan of his, if wasn't already.Loved Mamamoo's stage as well. I was worried because of the rain, but the worry was gone as soon as I saw their fans waiting for them, truly a loyal fanbase, always cheering for them. I haven't read upon Mamamoo and how they came to be, even though I do listen to their songs. However, Take 1 showed me their humble beginnings and I'm glad I listen to their songs as they are very talented and hardworking. Love how enthusiastic their fans are, it was funny and lovely seeing them so immersed in the concert. That medley sounds so good, as well. Also, their stage presence is amazing. I'm glad they did that little encore at then end!!I hope Netflix decides to do a second season."

Able to transform into human form, he eradicates supernatural beings that threaten the mortal world. His real aim is to find the reincarnation of his lost first love. The talented television producer Nam Ji Ah works in a show that features urban myths. In the past, her parents were involved in a mysterious car accident and disappeared, and she suspects that Lee Yeon might be connected with this accident. The half-brother to Lee Yeon is the captivating Lee Rang. Despite being half-human himself, he harbors a deep-seated contempt for all people. For sport, he will unleash his seductive prowess upon his human-du-jour, by promising to grant them their wishes, only to trick them into paying a hefty price for their earthly desires.","Hwang Hee, Jo Bo Ah, Kim Bum, Kim Jung Nan, Kim Yong Ji, Lee Dong Wook",tvN,"Without beating  around the bush, The Tale of Gumiho ( or the Nine Tailed Fox) s beginning did offer the criteria of being a brilliant  fantasy show ; a stellar cast, fairly strong  scriptwriting from episode one and of course the intriguing plot scenario of a lovelorn nine-tailed fox ( Lee Dong Wook)  desperately yearning to be human again and overcoming the emotional scars of his past. The Tale of Gumiho does certainly have one gift for  drama watchers  by offering us a  stellar cast line-up. Finally seeing  Lee Dong Wook  reprise  a fantasy role  again had to be an undeniable selling- point  for most drama watchers. In place of wearing  a prim and proper black hat  as a certain Grim Reaper, however, Dong Wook steps into his new character, Lee Yeon, by sporting freshly  dyed auburn red hair and brightly coloured suits as part of his foxy persona. There is no denying the fact that Dong Wook is undeniably Dong Wook in his performance - with a mixture of a sarcasm , comical wit and angst-driven ambiance surrounding his performance as Lee Yeon, its hard to imagine anyone else playing this mysterious trickster instead. In a similar manner to Dong Wook, Jo Bo- ah was stunningly brilliant as the female lead, Nam Ji- ah through her heart-driven wit and capability to portray a female lead with rationality and intelligence in the show  . Yet  sadly, however,  as far as the scriptwriting is concerned both characters undeniably fall short of expectations through how they are dealt with after the opening of the drama. Without revealing too much its fair to say that although both characters did respectfully  have emotional attachment to viewers through their experiences, some of the cliches that the scriptwriters had included  just didnt live up to expectations for these characters to be more than plot devices. ( Ji- ahs rationality and intelligence as a lead is seemingly flung out the window by the halfway point of the drama,  our main antagonist, Imoogi  played mostly by Lee Tae- Ri   has little intrigue forwatchers over his motives whereas  characters such as the Snail Bride, Taluipa and Hyun Eui-ong who shouldve have had some of the most intriguing  involvement  in the storyline, were simply played for comical effect instead). By the ending of this drama there was little development or actual intrigue around most of these characters. On the other hand, perhaps  the one thing ( alongside  the fairly good OST  ) which  most  certainly can be praised in regards to one element of the scriptwriting, is how they dealt with Kim Bums brilliantly sardonic and emotionally complex portrayal as the antagonist- antihero role , Lee Rang.Of course,  there is no denying that Rang did step often  beyond the points of morality in the drama even from episode one, yet revelations of Lee Rangs complicated past and his partially morally-guided  actions  throughout the drama such as  saving his faithful sidekick Yu-ri  ( Kim Yong Ji) from animal abuse in a zoo, a puppy from being tortured by a group of teenage thugs and Kim Soo oh ( Jung Si yul) from child abuse, adds more intricacy to him  simply being labelled as an  evil or  twisted character. Surprisingly, Kim Yong Jis performance as Yu- ri , also had better  characterisation than the majority our main leads as well. As a character, Yu- ri appears at first as somewhat detestable by her animalistic desires to eat humans and to deceive a married couple behind the truth that their daughter is dead. Yet as Rang reveals more about Yu-ris past, it soon becomes apparent through her growing relationship with the veterinarian Shin Joo ( Hwang Hee) that Yu-ri is again not entirely an evil character, but simply doing what she must in order to survive. It is only a shame that whilst Yu- ri undeniably had a good character progression by the ending of the show, the circumstances of Lee Rang, Lee Yeon and Ji-ah felt  lacklustre in comparison. It wasnt that the ending of the drama wasnt good, however, the means in which the scriptwriters had got us  to this ending felt rushed and lacking in both emotional investment and intrigue for watchers.Overall Tale of Gumiho was a fairly enjoyable show,  however, it was severely  flawed by character progression of our main leads as well as their relationship,  and the overall ending deliverance of the drama. Perhaps the two saving graces of the drama were the casting choices and evidently Kim Bums performance as   Lee Rang due to being a  complicated and intriguing antagonist up until  the ending , where sadly his final character twist and progression  felt too rushed. Whilst Tale of Gumiho is worth a watch, dont watch it if youre looking for a masterpiece, as there are certainly better fantasy dramas out there."

Meanwhile, another former guardian spirit and ex-friend Cheon Moo Young has become hostile. Lee Yeon struggles to return to the present, to his loved one.(Source: AsianWiki; edited by MyDramaList)","Hwang Hee, Kim Bum, Kim So Yeon, Kim Yong Ji, Lee Dong Wook, Ryu Kyung Soo",tvN,"From Laughter to Chills : Tale of The Nine Tailed 1938 Delivers an Unforgettable Experience  The show captivated viewers from start to finish, delivering thrilling & satisfying experience. It stands out as one of those rare instances where the sequel surpasses the original. Although S1 was enjoyable to me, S2 gained even more popularity & favor among audiences.When the show began, there were uncertainties surrounding the new Female Lead's romantic involvement with Yeon & revival of Rang who was easily most favourite character from S1. However, it gave satisfactory answers to all the curious viewers.Season 2 transported Main lead Yeon back 82 years to time when South Korea was still under Japanese colonial rule. The new season introduced plethora of new characters while retaining most of the original cast. Some characters remained unchanged, while one particular actress from S1 took on new & even more challenging role in S2.Two new leads were introduced as frenemies of Yeon. The first was Hong Joo, the current West Mountain God, an owl & second was Mu Young, the former North Mountain God, Siberian tiger harboring deep resentment towards Yeon. Mu Young sets the stage for Season 2 by time traveling to the year 1938 from year of 2020.Through time travel, Yeon reunites with his beloved little brother Rang, who is half fox & half human. Although their relationship remains love hate during this era, Yeon gradually wins Rang over. Additionally new villain emerges in the form of Akira Ryuhei, powerful Japanese ruler & demon.The show masterfully blended comedy & thriller elements. The comedic moments, primarily delivered by Yeon, Hong Joo, Shinjoo & Rang's loyal bandit boss were exceptional. The comedy was so well executed that it often left viewers laughing for several minutes after each scene.In terms of thrills, the show delivered exhilarating elements by incorporating Korean folklore inspired tracks. These tracks were engaging & kept viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the season.The execution of various fantasy thriller storylines was absolutely fantastic. It exemplified what fantasy show should be in contrast to another fantasy drama that aired on the same channel the previous year, which failed to provide similar level of excitement. Other writers should take notes from the creators of this drama on how to craft a captivating fantasy drama.Season 2 showcased strong bonds that had endured for centuries such as the brotherly bond between Yeon & Rang as well as Yeon's precious friendships with his past acquaintances. The scenes depicting these bonds were exceptionally well written & portrayed.Since romance was not the central focus of this season, show was able to give equal attention to all the major characters. It was refreshing to see how Eunho became entangled in the main plot, even though she was not directly connected to the leads in this season.Complex characters like Hong Joo & Mu Young were explored in great detail, adding depth to the storyline.The standout character of this season was Ryu Hong Joo who is new female lead of new season. Her strength & portrayal left lasting impact on viewers despite not being involved in any romantic storyline. She was the most powerful mountain god among all the mountain gods & possessed rare combination of strength, badassery & intelligence. Such characters are rarely seen in other shows making her a refreshing addition.Rang also underwent significant character development in this season. Initially harboring resentment towards his brother, he gradually softened & displayed more affection as the season progressed. His personal romantic storyline further added depth to his character.Mu Young was a complex character in the second season, starting off as smart villain. However some of his later choices raised questions about his intelligence. It would have been satisfying to see him handle situations more cleverly, as he had great potential. The writers should have provided valid reasons behind his actions which would have greatly enhanced his character development.In terms of acting, entire cast excelled in this drama, from the Baeksang Awardee Kim So Yeon to the minor Japanese mercenary characters introduced later on. Kim So Yeon's portrayal of the character Ryu Hong Joo, the West mountain god, was particularly impressive. Her expressions & delivery were always on point.Lee Dongwook & Kim Beom, as in the previous season, delivered fantastic performances, making Season 2 equally enjoyable. Their bromance was undoubtedly one of the highlights of the season.The other actors who portrayed characters like Mu Young, Ko Shinjoo, Bandit Boss, Jaeyoo, Akira Ryuhei & Eunhoo also did a fantastic job.The music in the season was great although personally I found S1's music & OST tracks to be even more memorable.While Season 2 had some flaws I won't delve into them because the pros easily outweighs the cons.All in all, this season was a truly enjoyable watch and exceeded my expectations. Now I will patiently wait for Season 3.Fantasy lovers should definitely not miss this masterpiece."

Universal takes that could make your life better. The acting was also good for a short web drama like this. Especially impressed with Kim Wook in episode 2 and his quick and effective change of performance. My biggest issue? Lackluster production.

A lot of action is guaranteed. The pace is high. There's nothing tear-jerking about. Romance has no place here. However there is room for emotions.Although the crimes are extremely brutal and unscrupulous as well as the fights and chases don't sugarcoat anything - Taxis Driver is overall fun to watch (not in the sense of funny though!). On the one hand, this is because the perpetrators are caught and the victims actually get 'help'. On the other hand, and above all, it is the actors. Not only the team around Kim Do-gi, also and especially the individual villains in male and female versions. While on the one hand turbulent action fills the time (yes, for me personally less would have been more, but that's probably a matter of taste), it's actually the theatrical performance of the mimes that characterize the esprit of the series. The fact that Do-gi has to slip into new roles for his assignments has a certain charm - i.e. sometimes he mimes the inexperienced substitute teacher,  sometimes the gallant, wide-legged criminal with a fur coat...It's still quite a brutal TV serial. That's because of the cases. Yet they aren't invented. It helps that there is room for a pinch of humour, harmless situation comedy and a wink every now and then.Despite all the vigilantism, which is the driving and fundamental premise of the entire series (and probably also of the 2nd season that is already planned), it is respectable: there is also a serious examination of justice/injustice, law/judiciary and the state's monopoly on the use of force. The brilliant public prosecutor Kang Ha-na in her idiosyncratic way and her team are excellently suited to this. The heroic deeds of the 'exemplary taxi crew' are thus not only whitewashed, but also rightly confronted. The script has in that sense hit a fine line that doesn't take away the joy of satisfaction, but still puts a question mark behind vigilantism, and thus gives credit to honest, committed and highly motivated law enforcement officers - because the country needs them. Vigilante justice, that should be clear, cannot and must not be the solution. (Human history is full of cultures of lynching and blood feuds - certainly this never did and will not promise a better world.)And then: the heroes of the story are human beings, too. Flashbacks provide an insight into the taxi team's traumatic, formative past while tying them into current cases. They too are victims. On this earth there is probably hardly any person who does not have had the experience of being a victim in the course of their life - more or less traumatical. It is an ugly feeling, a deeply shameful experience, as it reminds mankind of its greatest weakness: the ultimate loss of control and helplessness inherent in the finitude of being, the inevitable surrender that sooner or later everyone awaits.Accordingly, forgiveness and reconciliation are also a topic of this KDrama. However, this is ruled out as a serious option quite early on. A nice concept, yes, but rather not practicable, because people prefer to thirst for revenge. In this story, the emphasis is on the satisfaction of such. There are others, emphasizing that the pain doesn't go away with revenge. Because the fact remains: For a victim, the past cannot be reversed - in fact, the pain associated with it and the feelings surrounding it are rarely in the past anymore. They shape life from that moment on, become a part of it in the here and now. The experience cannot be erased or undone. In this respect, revenge on the perpetrator doentt help either. Taxi Driver gives less importance to this consideration. That's actually my only (but not insignificant) criticism. The series prefers to ride the obviously successful Speed&Action wave. Because otherwise that would have robbed the KDrama of the basis for the second season, so to speak. Consequently, they want to build on the success of the first. (Without Esom in the role of prosecutor Kang Ha-na, by the way, since she apparently left the actors crew due to other appointments.)"

Both leads are very good at making you like their characters, have good chemistry and overall are well-casted. I know them from other webdramas but here I could see another side of them.The story is bit cliche, however it does have this nice slice of life feel that makes me overlook the flaws. The clumsiness of young love is spot on and you can't help but root for the leads to finally get together. Definitely I will remember this webdrama fondly and might go back to rewatch it. It's just 4 episodes after all :)"

There is no reason this show should have been 20 hours long. At. all.While it may have started off cute, sweet, and romantic, it quickly devolved into just hours of NOTHING. If you watched Doctors (same writer) and realized NOTHING really happened in that drama....this one was even worse. I love the main actress, but I hated her character in this show. Right now, having just finished it a few hours ago, I am irrationally angry with myself for not allowing myself to drop this drama earlier in the series. I am mad that I sat through 20 hours of meandering and didn't really have any satisfaction at the end.I hated the way all the main females behaved and how they treated the men in their lives. The only decent female in the show was Soo Jung, the sommelier at Jung Seon's restaurant. Hyun Soo was a terrible character. I thought that Jung Seon had no strength. Hong Ah was a selfish brat. Kyung, while probably one of the cutest to me at first, just became irrationally stubborn in some of the later episodes. Jung Woo was just wronged by almost all of those he was closest to and treated well (save Jung Seon). The parents were not really good people. So, while the acting was decent for most of the cast....I didn't really like most of the characters.The music was nice, so that is a plus.I will never ever rewatch this. I could not give it zero stars.Please do not waste your time on this mess. Not even for Kim Jae Wook's cheekbones which, quite frankly, could have been the sole reason I even finished this stupid show."

The posters and teasers were full of a dark spark, promising the best dark romance in the drama land. Seductive and aesthetical was the description as well. And then, Episode one was a dive in reality. It seemed more of an episode from gossip girl rather than what it was promised to be. The characters were rich, spoiled youngsters, playing drama with anyone. Plus, the ""great seducer"" had, like one (?) girl seduced and that was it. So, seducer was more like a title that everyone repeated rather than the real deal. So, one should expect that the big plot will play nice and with a slow built up so that the drama will keep up with appearances. Well, that wasn't the case either. The romance was developed so fast, that we spent the rest of the episodes lovey dovey or breaking up. Wasn't the girl supposed to be  cold and not to believe in love? In addition, there were too many secondary characters, so many stories here and there, to, probably, distruct you from the main story that wasn't going as planned. But, they were boring too. Even the secondary love story didn't help. And there was the ending. I personally don't really like the ""five years later"" spin offs, but here we are, having one of those meaningless time skips, with no real ending. Finally, the acting was okay, and it did got a bit better, though, I think that Joy didn't fit her character. Maybe I see her more of the younger girl characters, in a more happy concept drama. I really enjoyed Min jae at least. He was a nice delightful surprise. So, 3 out of 10."

""Terius Behind Me"" playfully and lightheartedly balances between RomCom and spy thriller. The series dates back to 2018, but in view of the global corona pandemic, it is probably more up-to-date than intended. That makes the spy story a bit very serious in retrospect. Otherwise, ""My Secret, Terrius"" is a bit funny - the investigations and relationship dynamics intertwine in  capricious ways. It's a bit cute - with the two twins as well as a second ""romance"" in the subplot. A bit tart - the legendary star spy undercover as an inexperienced babysitter for two bright six-year-olds. Between the two main leads, it's actually a bit about romance, too. But there is also room for a bit of bromance - male friendships. And there is a little something in it for handbag freaks.An exclusive highlight in ""Terius Behind Me"", however, is the Korean style neighborhood watch - the distinctive esprit of the mothers' association of the Kingsman neighborhood, that is characterized by notorious curiosity (by the way, a man is part of that, too). As the Kingsman Information System (KIS), they prove to be several times superior to the National Intelligence Service (NIS) - especially in terms of efficiency when it comes to their high-tech networking and highly motivated investigations.In passing, you also gather some impressions of life in typical high-rise condominiums in Seouls new development areas, the over-committed mothers in such neighborhoods, and (in case I didnt already mention it before)... handbags... :-)With ""My Secret, Terrius"" the KDrama shows what it can do, too: simply entertain.

Other than that, the drama was seriously boring. The love story was bleak, the magic fantasy mythology incomplete and never explained properly, the plot was tiring to watch and follow and overall, the pace was too slow and the ending horrible.

While the story has an admirable message, it suffers from being just competent. There is nothing that has been done exceptionally well, and nothing that is exceptionally bad; aside from a few of the plot lines being nigh unwatchable. The show suffers from a lack of creativity; it won't stand out, and will be forgotten quite fast. The plot is too predictable, the setting uninteresting and the character arcs. The plot twists are easy to see, and the conflicts quite obvious. It feels a bit rushed in writing, there is a good message in this story but it's like they didn't have time to edit the script to throw in a few surprises, improve the comedy, and make more compelling character arcs. This show is average to a fault; you can watch it, but it doesn't pull you in, it doesn't know how to be compelling and I think this is because once you've seen several family dramas this one hasn't figured out what it's good at, and has not focused on that.

HOWEVER, despite this, I was still engaged with this show and enjoyed it even though it was flawed. 

My first criticism is for the plot. I want to preface this by saying that I've never read the comic, so I wasn't influenced in any way by the source material. The issue is that the backstory information that would have been so helpful to understanding what was going on was dribbled out like crumbs on the trail in Hansel and Gretel. I wanted to know more, but the writers would have the characters give some cryptic piece of dialogue and then fail to explain well enough that I felt satisfied as a viewer. The answers came ""too little, too late"" for many people and I felt somewhat like that myself. I was mostly satisfied with the answers we finally received, but not 100%. I also tend to believe that the budget may have been cut early on. The reason I say so is because the ""realm of the gods"" was only shown briefly, even though it was splendid. And Ha Baek came through to the human's realm without his powers. He was able to use them twice, and they were marvelous special effects, but then they were not used again. I think they made a good choice to cut the special effects rather than lose production value, but I think they made it a little obvious anyway since the show really could have been something special with a bigger budget. 

The acting was fine, but not phenomenal. I think Nam Joo Hyuk was not quite the right choice for Ha Baek. He's adorable, sure. And I've enjoyed his other works. But I don't know that he carried the weight of the role as well as a more experienced actor may have. He wasn't a horrible choice, but I just think they could have done better. On the plus side he was VERY cute. :) And Shin Se Kyung got a lot of criticism for her acting, but I don't think she is a bad actress at all. She played her role fine. The chemistry between the two was hit and miss. Sometimes I thought it was there, and other times, not so much. Im Joo Hwan really knocked it out of the park, though, and was one of the lone actors that really stood out in this show. So much so, that a lot of viewers kept watching for him alone. The other actors were fine. Not anything special, but just fine. 

Now, the music on the otherhand, was beautiful. I absolutely loved the track, Glass Bridge. Mesmerizing song! I don't know the names of the others, but the music was lovely. The cinematography was beautiful as well. 

I can't say I would re-watch this. Maybe after I read the comic, more of the story will fall into place and I'll understand it better, but that's about it. I do think they ended the show much better than I was expecting, even if it was a bit anticlimactic. This show wasn't horrible by any means, and I hate that so many people gave up on it so quickly. But it was a decent watch even though it didn't live up to its potential. I'm not mad I spent the time watching it."

In terms of overall quality, this season is a solid 10. It just didn't grip me the way I want drama's to, so I took some points off for overall enjoyment.As far as what the story is like, it's the same setup as season one. Slice of life told in a series of vignettes with food playing an important role. There are more yummy looking recipes that I wish I had the desire and motivation to make myself (alas, I have made a lifetime vow against cooking as we are mortal enemies), and the female lead is as interesting and relatable as she was in the first season.If you watched the first season and liked it, you will enjoy this season."

And yet, somehow... I love this drama. I could not explain why, but I was interested from the beginning till the end. Everything just worked well and made me anticipate the next episode.One of the best parts of the drama for sure was the acting. Dare I say, this was the best Seo Jin Goos role. While I am sad we did not get more scenes with the mad king (boy he was an amazing character and interesting to watch), Jin Goo's emotional scenes as Ha Sun were just as captivating. The duality in his performance left me in awe. I also appreciate that we as viewers could easily see which character we were currently watching on the screen. They had distinguishing characteristics, so I was never left in confusion.That said, the whole show was stolen by Haksan, the loyal Chief Royal Secretary. The most complex character in the drama, with an amazing development and true depth. The internal and external conflicts he had to face were heartbreaking and made me cry more than once. I always anticipated his scenes and wished there were more of them, even though he was already one of the main characters. Kim Sang Kyung truly aced the role.The weakest parts of the drama were romance and the villains. While Queen So Woon might have been a loyal and nice person, there was not much to her character, except for being the support for Ha Sun.It was interesting to watch the villains try to win, but from the get go it was obvious they had no chance in this fight. All of the battles were too weak and they lost too easily and quickly.All things considered, somehow this drama worked perfectly and was a true enjoyment to watch. Would recommend watching it for sure and I'm extremely happy I decided to try it myself."

Unsettling to some extent. Additionally to an enthralling story you get great acting.  ""The Cursed"" puts Korean shamanism at the center of events. Shamans play their role again and again in KDramas - even if they are only indirectly present in the form of yellow adhesive talismans in red Hanja writing for fertility, luck, prosperity, etc. But in ""The Cursed"" they actively determine what happens. The shamans are distinguished by their spirit conection and/or have inherited their practice. To this day, Muism or Sindo - the shaman religion - is firmly rooted in everyday life as the oldest popular belief system.So you inevitably have to deal with magical rituals, shamanistic practices and (in this case) evil spirits who quickly possess people or e.g.. rather curse them. It is quite somber and frightening considering that mere human ability has little to counter these forces and practices.Viewer ratings have more than doubled over the course of the TVseries. For South Korean audiences, the KDrama obviously struck a chord. For me it was an intense drama. Thrilling. Unsettling to some extent. Generally, I would recommend it, if you are open to face another realm besides our rational reality.  Additionally to an enthralling story you get great acting. (No romance, though...)"

","Jeon Chae Eun, Ji Sung, Kim Jae Kyung, Kim Min Jung, Park Gyu Young, Park Jin Young",tvN,"Dystopian must mean American in Korean lol  I heard so many good things about this drama before I started watching but I was still hesitant because I have mixed feelings about law and corruption dramas. Sometimes I am bored by political corruption tropes, but it was clear from the beginning that this drama is much more stylized. It's dystopian, but also super realistic. It has some very entertaining characters and an antihero who's exciting to root for.  ""The Devil Judge"" is a mysterious character with questionable methods, similar to a Vincenzo-type, and I loved ""Vicenzo"".  Yes, it is about politics, corruption, and revenge... what you would normally expect from a drama like this...  but it's also about morality and human nature which is way more interesting to me, with characters that blur those lines in the best way.Ji Sung is perfectly cast as Kang Yo Han, a popular celebrity judge who shows no mercy when it comes to exacting justice.  This is an iconic role, and he really gets to showcase his charm and the nuances in his acting. Obviously, he is no stranger to playing complicated characters, ""Kill Me, Heal Me"" is my favorite performance of his, but this is definitely a close second. I love characters that don't neatly fall under the category of bad or good, and he straddles that line in the most attractive ways. He's also the type of character who is usually 3 steps ahead of everyone else, which is fun, but also tortured by his past which is heartbreaking. He is matched with Park Jin Young as Kim Ga On, an ambitious new lawyer whose idealistic and often self-righteous ideas clash with Yo Han. It's the unlikely bond between them that drives most of this story. I loved their bromantic chemistry, and unconventional mentor dynamic.  Ga On is frustrating at times, many MANY times, but his charm always shines through. I think he was perfectly cast in his role as well. They worked so well together.The entire cast in this drama is great, and it almost feels unfair not to mention them all, but some of the performances were just exceptional... think broad comic book characters more than melodrama. I loved Jeon Chae Eun as Elijah. Her relationship with Yo Han was a strong highlight in this drama for me. Park Gyu Young as Soo Hyun, on the other hand, was a character I loved to complain about. Most of the time she was on the screen I was rolling my eyes, but I actually did appreciate her relationship with Ga On, even if it seemed obsessive and the friendzoning became one-note, I did think they were cute together. Don't expect a full-blown romance arc for these two. It's more about her influence on Ga On than about watching them falling in love.  Other standout performances worth mentioning are Jang Young Nam as the Minister of Justice. I loved her unapologetic ruthlessness and powerful pantsuit vibes. Also Baek Hyun Jin as The President  who I just call K-Trump based on his over the top antics and narcissism that seemed way too similar to the former clown in the American White House (I don't think the similarities were accidental either lol). There are a lot of characters to know but as the story evolves it's more about The Goal of the Devil Judge than remembering exactly who's who. It's also about the general publics reaction  to easy access justice, so I consider the app voting masses important characters as well. Surpisingly, my favorite character, whose performance I loved even more than Ji Sung's is Kim Min Jung as Jung Sun Ah. Every scene she had with Ji Sung was my favorite.  I wasn't sure if I wanted them to fight or date but  just a look or light touch between them was electrifying. I don't want to say too much about her character but it's one of the best performances I've seen is a while.  Her soft-spoken [emailprotected] is legendary.Would I watch this again? Possibly, but there are some flaws in the drama that would make me a little hesitant to.  One is that the story is pretty predictable. Anticipating what would happen was still fun, but I'm not sure if it would be as entertaining the second time. The performances are fun but were a little repetitive. I was excited to watch each week but it may drag if I were to binge watch it again. I do think that knowing the characters better may make me appreciate the earlier episodes more. I would definitely be tempted to skip to certain scenes. Many of the scenes are beautifully shot however, so maybe I can appreciate some just for the look of it all. Overall, this drama is well done, but imperfect. I could easily nitpick the things that made no sense or were ridiculous, like why didn't Ga On ever go home??!! Or why was Soo Hyun always investigating alone??! I also didn't love the ending. It was pretty much what I expected, and was entertaining to watch, but I guess I was hoping to be more surprised or wowed. I loved that this drama challenged the idea that morality or justice are clearly defined. Self righteous characters aren't necessarily heroes and brutal villainous-types can also be empathetic. If you like watching  manipulation and revenge that's played out like a game of chess, then this drama delivers. If you don't need romance, but might love a complicated bromance, then this drama is a must watch.  It was funny to see that some things that are normal in America are dystopian in KDramaland... all we need is the app. Maybe being to jaded has kept this from being a new favorite of mine, but it definitely gets a thumbs up vote from me."

The plot synopsis here in MDL is a little bit different from the actual story, in the series Yu Dam has lived for 300 years and Dong Baek was in fact a man in his first iteration. And no, they dont die, only Dong Baek is bound to die.The format for Korean BLs are just too short to be properly appreciated. I just dont understand why they cant just increase the episode runtime to better tell the story.There is an ambitious premise hidden somewhere. It is a fantasy romance and yes, they were trying to do something different from other BL by telling a unique love story that spans hundred of years. It reminded me of another Korean BL ""First Love Again"".  However, just like that series, this story looks good on paper but has failed  in execution. What we got are 10 16-minute episodes that spends the first 2 and a half minute recapping and showing the opening credits and another minute and a half end credits. The problem is there is just not enough story in the 12 minute remaining time  for me to chew upon. There wasnt enough to savour the characters, it wasnt even enough to taste their chemistry. The title says The Director Who Buys Me Dinner, but after the first 2 episodes the dinner between Director Min Yu Dam and Soel Dong Baek stopped. I would have loved to see it every episode like some sort of closing  credit. The fantasy side also wasnt fully explained, there wasnt any proper explanation about how the curse happened, or how the director lived for hundreds of years? Do we even really consider living a long life a curse?  Did he meet any previous Dong Baek aside from the first and the current one? Who was that who possessed Dong Baek? Was the curse lifted by the end of the story or if he is still aware that he is or was immortal? Did he just suddenly also forget about his long life? What happens to Dong Baek at the end?Also, whats the point of the Denis character?What's sad is you can actually see the making of a good series under all the ingredients they were trying to shove in your mouth. If they just spent a little more time baking the story, and maybe just adding a little more sugary sweetness it would have been great. I used to like short series but after a few duds i am starting to hate the format. It is very evident that in this series , the short runtime worked against their favor. Open ended stories are good way to end stories but here it just felt lazy."

I watched this because I'm a sucker for web dramas and I like to give the very underrated or unknown ones a shot too, but if I have to be completely honest anything that has the word mermaid in it will make me watch it. This however doesn't have actual mermaids in it, but despite the lack of my merpeople it was still cute to watch.

First of all, the story is incredibly disappointing: predictable, filled with plot holes, conveniently lucky at times to save the protagonist, and overall filled with frustrating pacing. 
The characters that began with promise quickly lost their luster, with probably only Hwa Gun becoming an actually well-written character by the end. Yoo Seung Ho is an outstanding actor with both talent and heart-melting looks, but his character is inconsistent, annoying, and stuck in a plot that doesn't seem to go anywhere until the end. Same with Kim So Hyun- I absolutely adore her in her previous works, but Ga Eun is written so blandly that I really could retain interest in her. As for L (Myung Soo), he actually exceeded all expectations in his performance, but again- his character had many inconsistencies in writing to be of interest. 
THE SOLE REASON FOR WATCHING THIS would have to be Hwa Gun. Now, Yoon So Hee isn't the greatest actress out there- she does need some work on her annunciation and just more experience in general. However, she did a great job as Hwa Gun and certainly improved from her past roles. It seems that all of the character development that was supposed to happen to everyone else just poured into her instead. Solidly written and developed, Hwa Gun is a character balanced in virtues and flaws who becomes vital to both the story and the audiences attention. One of my all-time favorite characters.
Dae Mok began as an interesting villain, but quickly fell into the category of antagonists that I like to call ""Fire Lord Ozais"". [Note: If you've seen Avatar: The Last Airbender, you'd know that the overarching villain is Fire Lord Ozai. However, throughout most of the story, Princess Azula is the truer and much better antagonist with clear complexities and motivations, reducing Ozai to more of a figurehead.] Dae Mok does get some backstory, but it's vague and undeveloped, making him a simplified figure of evil that our boringly righteous protagonists may fight with.
There may be solid actors in this drama, but not even they can save poor writing. The music was amazing, but it's not particularly memorable nor surprising for a high budget sageuk.
If you enjoy overly dramatic sageuks with actors that are easy on the eyes, go for it if you have 20 hours to spare."

She is an ambitious figure who is not satisfied with her current position and aims to become a prosecutor general or someone higher up the ladder.,"Ahn Jae Wook, Kim Sun Ah, Lee Mi Sook, Oh Hyun Kyung, Shin Goo, Song Young Chang",jTBC ViuTV,"Dynamite is lurking everywhere that could bring the Empire down... but who dares to set it on fire?  First of all: should you watch ""The Empire""? In any case. Yes! But: The KDrama isn't funny or soul food at any point... Rather, it provokes by intelligently and multi-layeredly confronting the ugly sides of the glamorous world as well as the almost hopeless rebellion against it.""The Empire"" stylizes the world of that top 1-10 percent, that outrageously wealthy and influential elite of society who can afford a lifestyle that the rest of society dreams of. At the same time, this elite presents itself as mendacious, bigoted, moral scum. Dynamite is lurking everywhere and could explode at any moment. The KDrama paints a dull, tired, bored, vile, quarreling picture of the rich - not a radiantly beautiful one brimming with vitality. Wealth is displayed in a feudal manner, but it seems a bit pietistic, even from the outside it's rather cold, empty, stale and sad. The color saturation has been reduced accordingly. Some clichs are tickled. Privileged decadence is predominant. Elitist arrogance rules the luxurious, isolated orbit of a calculating, selfish family dynasty. Everything here is expensive, bare, distant, decadent, and nothing is welcoming, warm, beautiful, or friendly. With all that wealth and success, no one is free or happy. Trust is a foreign word in this family. This makes the KDrama hard to bear in places.The conservative elite in ""The Empire"" feigns progressiveness by throwing snippets of English into their conversations. However, this seems artificial (dramaturgically quite effective) and (yet) not very convincing, rather quite strange, because their arrogant fantasies of exclusivity are nothing more than mendacious, feudally inspired traditions, old energy full of cobwebs. When the young, life-disappointed but highly talented student brazenly appears in front of the self-proclaimed aristocrats on her vendetta, it is downright unheard of. But basically it is exactly that and much more of it, what it takes to push the dusty elitist behavior to its limits and ultimately really abolish it. There is no awe in this young woman. It may be that she has the courage of the desperate. Never mind After all! The modern system is already stumbling through her presumptuous impertinence. Interesting that this brave young woman is actually introduced as the bad guy - because we as viewers see the story (initially) through the indignant eyes of the self-ennobled nouveau riche - those who want to represent a class of their own and who are used to directing fortunes behind closed doors according to their interests. To a certain extent, the dramaturgy identifies 'us' with those who govern the ""Empire"". 'We' are identified with order being maintained and respected. And yet it is difficult for 'us' to side with them. This elitist world presents itself as too lost, too sick, too decadent. ... This collision of two worlds is highly explosive and wonderfully depicts the inner turmoil and contradictions within society.In between, the journalist seems a bit helpless as a plaything for those who provide her with information for her interests. Despite all the bite she has, she is first on the hunt for her own professional success. The 'thing', what needs to be researched and uncovered, becomes a means to a personal end. Journalism, with its democratic mission, is thus also floating on the edge of decadence and gives little hope. (Yet, hope there is...)And then there is the protagonist Han Hye-ryul: herself a child of that problematic, ambivalent elite, third generation of the empire full of influential lawyers founded by her grandfather. At the same time bearer of hope for a modern democratic society. She takes her responsibility seriously and uses the opportunities that her origins gave her in the cradle constructively in the service of the community - she does NOT bend the law according to her personal discretion, but her truly innovative credo is: she sticks to it for ALL binding law. She tries to follow her professional path with true integrity. Such genuine integrity gives hope to the masses. On the other hand, they frighten the elite, because this robs them of the foundation of their shadow power.However, the torchbearer of legal integrity is, beyond her professional ethics, also a person who grew up in a world full of privileges. As a child of the elite, she not only automatically inherits money, fame and influence, but also old guilt, and when in doubt she is pilloried. As a woman, she has feelings like everyone else. As a wife, or rather a betrayed wife, too. As a daughter. And as a mother too. She is therefore challenged on several fronts at the same time. ""The Empire"" tells the story of a woman who, out of deep conviction and belief in a legal system, wants to undermine the autocratic, arrogant elite coalition. However, she is the child of a family that is involved in such things whether she wants to or not. And yet it is precisely this family tradition that makes her the full-blooded prosecutor that she is. By tradition, she wants to do her work excellently and in an exemplary manner. And for her personally, that means cleaning up the mess of backroom deals and exclusive privileges. Finally someone who believes the rule of law is above ALL? And not only that: the protagonist is one with an ego that (luckily in this case?) is strong enough to actually take on the powerful enemies. So is there perhaps still hope for a better, fairer world? ""The Empire"" works intelligently on this question. There is no easy answer to that. The crushing moral swamp to traverse is overwhelming...... And then there is the fourth generation in the family clan... the son of Han Hye-ryul. He actually ticks quite differently ... for his part, he is the bearer of hope for a new dimension. He wants to swim his way out of the swamp of tradition, and yet he is torn between his feelings for his parents and grandparents and his own needs and desires. He doesn't dare, and yet...------------------ Side note: --- Inflation of KDrama productions, in which the rich and powerful take center stage in the context of law and order--- The corrupt networks, which want to reach the top circles and the blue house, have become an almost inflationary context for KDramas and movies. A trend that has already been observed in recent years. But 2022 will surpass everything that has been produced so far. ""The Empire"" is one of many 2022 productions that settle accounts with the discrepancy between free democracy, responsible citizens and equal rights for all on the one hand and class society, strict traditions, hierarchies and autocracy on the other. ""The Empire"" unashamedly and unequivocally, without any ribbons or icing on the cake, unveils how difficult and long the road still is - to a society in which citizens are actually all treated equally before the law. There is obviously still one instance of power that in 2022 in South Korea is firmly convinced that it is above the law...Why is the profusion of KDrama productions, in which the rich and powerful take center stage in connection with law and order, so inflated at the moment? So that it maybe/hopefully slowly really sinks into mass consciousness and from there it gets to each individual that this must/want/can come to an end! So sledgehammer: monarchical Joseon is history! Aristocracy and class society are history! Dictatorship is history. Let's go South Korea! Stand tall, walk tall! Don't be blinded. Don't be tempted to join in with this old class thinking and to feel a little more valuable if you have someone you can trample on...No more reverence and respect. No more feudal lords and serfs. Actually, this is presented every week in KDrama, in the cinema and in the news: that the venerable elite is actually morally rather underground and such a life is neither honorable nor desirable. But as long as the viewer's gaze continues to be dazzled by arrogant behavior and luxury items and prefers to look past the lazy core, there will (have to) be endless KDrama variations with sometimes bigger or sometimes smaller sledgehammers. But that's not surprising either, because the centuries, even millennia-old, tradition teaches something completely different... it has been class-thinking all along...Nonetheless. South Korea counts the year 2022. It is official: We (even in KDrama Land) ALL have a value and worth regardless of origin, past or future - not just a few percent wearing particularly expensive clothes. Wealth or poverty or anything in between and beyond is independent of a person's worth before the law. If we, who apply the law, still act according to other laws, allow ourselves to be seduced and bought and used, secretly hoping to be able to take such a quick shortcut further up, then it is our own fault. No one has the right to beat us, use and exploit us and throw us away after use like garbage! No one. ----------------------------------------"

You might have to get used to it. At least I did. The first time I approached the series I probably wasn't ready and possibly not in the right mood for such cheerful, tongue-in-cheek fun  la Korean style. I gave up quite early (probably after the first episode). On the second try tough, everything just fell into place. And by now I can say from experience: ""The Fiery Priest"" is ideal for repeat offenders. I had even more fun then... (And that probably wasnt the last time I watched...)Nonetheless. Korean humor is special, especially when it comes to the fascination of the intestines - often enough they are  gladly celebrated in a wide variety. Here as well. Utter confusion and frenzy are also a must. Instead of tried and tested bar fights and brawls of the western type however, the focus here is rather on choreographed martial arts.Humor reigns supreme in ""The Fiery Priest"". Humor determines the pace, the timing, the nuances and the ambience. Slapstick, situation comedy, dialogue jokes, parody, irony - hardly anything is left out. ""The Fiery Priest"" doesn't take itself too seriously. The central storyline says it all: in the robes of a priest a former NIS agent ensures order and justice. Even the Pope has his brief appearance here. But also the 'sects' with self-appointed saviors flourishing in the country.And yet, the ""The Fiery Priest"" has some serious tones to offer, too - besides and in the middle of all the slapstick. The plot background is once again fueled by South Korean backroom liaisons between executive, judiciary, politics and crime. With regard to the personality development of the individual characters, touching emotional moments also come along here and there - comparatively modestly, but nevertheless with impact. Finally, ""The Fiery Priest"" also plays out another strength of KDrama: Here you can experience a lot of cheerfully and yet subtly touchingly executed bromance and womance. (However, there's no romance. But nobody has to miss it.) Bromance and womance as well as the variety of embedded side plots inspirit dramaturgical facets, that may touch the heart, having quite something to offer between soft touch and punch. It is simply a pleasure to watch the various dynamic personality developments. (Outstanding actors all along, by the way!)""The Fiery Priest"" spectacularly succeeds in balancing a tightrope act - good-humoredly and mischievously dancing above an unspeakable swamp of injustice, bribery, abuse of power and human greed.

I can even tell this drama is secretly gay because of the intense gay scene in the 2nd episode hehehe...?What captivates me here is the unusual story of the bullies and their victim. The victim is not written from the position of the weak but from the position of an average-confidence person who actively seeks for the way out.?The exploration of friendship is pretty decent here. People from the same criminal background are gathered in one high school but they act differently, e.g. TaeSan who ""never beats anyone up with no reason"" on the contrary to the red haired guy who lies in wait for the person to be in the most vulnerable position to attack him. Some only need money to communicate, some need understanding.?The actors... Oh, well. Kwak DongYeon pulls it off very well as usual even though this is one of his very first roles.

They gave him a strong background story, a human side when he was doubting his own actions and wanting to change, and a some interesting connections with the main characters. The romance, however, felt a bit fake. It was more like love in the first sight, as the drama focused more on the case than the couple, as it should really.

With a high-end production team in every instance, ""The Glory"" cleverly intertwines the burning subject of bullying with the long-running topic revenge campaign. The result is gripping, intense, a success all round. (However, one major criticism: Netflix cuts the story in half with a long break in between.)In 2022, for the sad issue of bullying, streaming services cleared the stage several times with their own productions (e.g. ""Weak Hero Class 1"" and ""Revenge of Others""). All of these stories are unbelievable in their brutality and cruelty - teenagers against teenagers! No mercy. Without pity. Without scruples. Without any feeling of guilt. For once, I don't want to blame the streaming providers for the shown cruelty, on the contrary. Maybe the topic is in better hands with them because they have no problem with such radical scenes (compared to TV stations). Isnt it simply scandalous that such unbelievable violent abuse - and may it be only half as drastic - is part of everyday life in (i.e. South Korean) schools and among young people? Even more scandalous: parents and teachers tolerate it or actively support it and even act up themselves.""The Glory"" swings back and forth between past and present and thus draws a complex picture of the individual characters. Back then the perpetrators, they are becoming victims today. Back then the victim, she finally wants to get out of her role and also make life hell for her abusers. The painful past provides the moral framework, allowing the audience to nod off the plans for vigilantism. Eventually, the protagonist also gains helpers on her way.Sad enough, in ""The Glory"" no one is truly happy with their life except for the perpetrator's (still) innocent little daughter. The bullies of that time live bored and/or stoned and still trapped in their bullying role. Still tangled up in their clique from back then in uneasy ties. None of them found true friends. Trust and love are words without substance in their life, which rather appears as a shiny variation of Hell disguised with silk and glamourous accessories.The victim of that time, on the other hand, has found meaning, direction and grounding in her life, no matter how sad the circumstances. Coincidentally, she even made trustworthy friends. Since she has experienced firsthand what hell is like, she can at least distinguish it, as other experiences of brief moments of happiness are also indicated in between. This experience (how happiness actually feels compared to suffering) puts her ahead of her opponents, who aren't even aware that they're living in a hell of emotional emptiness. They only suspect it when Moon-Dong-eun threatens to shake their house of cards and they have to face the illusions of their self-satisfied lives.The story isnt completely told yet - after 8 episodes. We will see, how things actually turn out for Moon Dong-eun, as she is indeed messing with someone, who is not willing to give in, whatsoever...---------- EDIT after finishing the SECOND SEASON: -------------------Well. Second season is definitely on the revenge-side. Some may say revenge is sweet. In any case it is drastic. And ""the Glory"" made sure, the mean-spirited deserved it... Among them is so much violence and exorbitant abuse. Almost too much to bear at times. A bit overdone maybe with unnecessary Netflix ruction here and there. Nevertheless suspenseful. Certainly with a coherent ending.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------PS.:Actually, the screenwriter is herself  mother of a high school student...)----------------------------------------------------SIDE NOTE: ---- Fiction and reality are not that far apart ---Some might say that the bullying brutality in ""The Glory"" - such as the curling wand scene - was exaggerated. In fact, in South Korea in 2006, there was just such a case. At a middle school in Cheongju, a student was bullied for money by three classmates. For not delivering, she was beaten with a baseball bat, tormented with a barrette, kicked, hit with fists, and burned on her arms with a hot curling wand. The burns didn't even have time to heal because the girls checked the temperature of the curling iron on the victim's arms again and again every few days. On the contrary, healing blisters were specifically removed by the bullies with their fingernails.

The first thing that needs to be applauded is the actors and their masterful acting. Without the acting the plot would've withered as another project  with lost potential. They literally breathe the life, the fury, the glory into this drama.As a sequel, it is commendable that the show did not go overboard or underwhelm in any aspect. It was just enough to make you sigh a breath of satisfaction. Lives upto everything the first season built upto and the trailer predicted. No non-sensical plot points which were forced to make the story coherent. It was woven smoothly start to end. They delivered the dramatics perfectly. Their was no unnecessary romantic part which ruined the slow-burn. Despite all the first season's information, there were twists and turns and the thrill was maintained. If anything was over-done, one wouldn't really give this show much of a rewatch value. But the makers took their jobs seriously and made sure that people can come back to this and find hope in the victory of everything good.People might argue about the amorality of the whole revenge plot itself, but we know that justice does not take place in our world very often, the world is very unfair, and people we know, people around us, and people like us may feel wronged everyday, but what we can take from this as a positive learning is that we all need to come together and help the Dong Eun's all around us by giving them support, and being a friend in their time of need. Of course is doesn't have to be an elaborate revenge plot, but even the smallest effort would go a long way. And at the end of the day what goes around comes around. So it is by each other's support that we move forward, otherwise we'll find ourselves stuck at a point in life which will sooner or later drive us crazy."

Rather, it decreases in entertainment value gradually to reach the well expected and predictably lukewarm ending. And the main culprit of that outcome is the main story. Even though the small cases that were presented were suspenseful and thrilling, the main story was a been there seen that. It was cliche, with boring villains and a confusing and thus, messy mystery. The romance that was added was unnecessary and the main characters were uninteresting and too basic with no extra qualities to set them apart from the rest.

This is the first Yook Sung Jae series that I have completed (I tried  his last show but i cant get past the second episode). This guy is handsome and has the acting chops to boot. Here, as Lee Seung Chun, he caught me in his trap from the very first episode. Something about his pain from being born poor felt effective and believable, and you want him to get out of his desperate situation even if it means somebody else will suffer in his place. As a viewer you'd want to give him the best too.To be rich, he has to take the place of Hwang Tae Yong, who at first, seems like a despicable character. After a few episodes he managed to switch places, unfortunately for Seung Chun, it is not all greener on the other side as he found out that even the rich Tae Yong has his own personal challenges and demons of his own. Even more unfortunate for Seung Chun,  Lee Jong Won's good performance as the new Seung Chun is even better than the original, that you cant help but root for him even more than Sung Jae.Golden Spoon has managed to convey the rich versus poor comparison very well, albeit, they showed it in a way that poor is synonymous with good and rich is synonymous with evil.We later found out that there was not only one but quite a few of these golden spoons, which, like I said in the beginning, kind of reduced the importance of the show's most powerful selling point. It felt like a lazy attempt to build the show's tension, to the point that when the last spoon user was revealed, it didnt have the imapct they hoped to create and my eyes just rolled up too high thought it left my skull. It was  a waste of cameo from Na In Woo.Has anyone noticedbhow the seemingly good hearted granny selling these golden spoons is nothing but a creepy Rumpelstiltskin-like character. She just doesn't give a sh*t if the spoon destroys lives, just as long as you buy the spoon. I would have wanted to see her true evil colors, and that she gives all those who used the spoons get what they deserve in return,  which comes to that ending that I hated - Seung Chun should have been punished (or at least got the karma he deserved) but instead he got out almost unscathed and looks like he will manage to win the girl after all. Overall, im still giving it an 8 out of 10. Would i rewatch? Probably not, although Im looking forward to seeing more of Yook Sung Jae and Lee Jong Won's other works."

The first couple of episodes were confusing to me, because it felt like there were too many characters and too many people involved that i didnt know where the story was headed. But once you get past Lee Dae Chul's case, the story becomes clearer.2. There were still some moments where it gets frustrating because i wanted the team to find enough evidence to catch Jong Tae and Guk Hyun and everyone so bad, i also felt like them, that i just want to manipulate the case to get this over with.3. The team worked really hard to solve the cases (and there were a lot!!). I would say justice has been served to the bad guys (in some way or the other).4. I appreciated how the stories and characters were written. Most of the characters were complex. As much as i would like to hate all the bad guys, the writers show us a different side to them, not to like or forgive them, but to understand their motivation. The same way that we also see that the good guys are not always so good. They also make bad decisions that can have great consequences. And then there are people who are neither good or bad, but goes with the flow in order to survive. I guess that's just how we are as human beings.5. The show mostly was dark and gritty, but once in a while there's some humor that lightens the mood (mostly from the VC team 2), and a subtle romance between Jihyuk and Jin, which balances the story drama.6. Also liked how the story delved with Dochang's and Eunhye's relationship. Although i didnt really like the sister and didnt care for her story, i loved how they built their own family in the end.Dislikes:I thought that Superintendent Moon and Yoon Sangmi werent punished enough. Just because they repented and moved to the good guys side do not give them a free pass from due punishment.Rating: 8.5/10"

Its not an emotional roller-coaster of a thriller but rather a piece that is two thirds cerebral chess and one third comedic camaraderie. They make strange bedfellows and perhaps attract different types of audience hence my comment about prior expectations. The plot concerning the standard chaebol rivalries is a complete contrast to the fun-filled dynamics of Violent Crime Team 2 and sometimes the constant shifting is like plunging from the sauna into the ice-bath. (I did that once and thought I was having a heart attack!)Lets deal with the cerebral chess first. Although complexity is good, too much complexity can interfere with the flow and pace of the drama. It gets a bit tangled up with itself and there are a lot scenes that use a lot of names to explain the intricacies of who knows what about who said what about who threatened who because of what was done about what who ordered There is a balance to be struck by the writer when constructing the plot and here I think the tendency to keep explaining is counterproductive as it breaks the both the tension/suspense and the flow of the viewers emotional connections to the characters and story. I wasnt totally convinced that it was necessary and at times things felt a bit repetitive. The downside of not explaining is that the viewer sometimes get lost but it allows you to keep up the pace and tension. I think this was done very effectively in Insider where an equally (if not more) complex plot swept along and carried you with it.As the drama progresses it gets bogged down in the nitty gritty and where it is going has been obvious for a while, with the result that it becomes somewhat tedious and struggles in the last half to capture interest. This is partly because it is rooted in a slice of life approach that sort-of abides by the rules of investigation which slows everything down and keeps it grounded. It also emphasises dialogue over action and there are too many static scenes of people sitting around on chairs and talking.Having plunged into the ice bath lets go back to the sauna, and what a fantastic sauna it is. Especially in the first half the camaraderie of Violent Crime Team 2 is a total delight. Its wonderfully funny and so warm. All of the detectives have distinct personalities and are given opportunities to shine. It totally enlivens the first half of the drama and makes it such a enjoyable watch. If it ended half way through the drama would definitely be a higher rating.Along with the performances by the detectives, the standout for me was Jung Moon Sung as Woo Tae Ho. I was really riveted by his performance and he totally convinced me that he was a man surrounded on all sides with only his wits to aid him to survive. And lastly, just a nod to casting for actually finding someone (Jasper Cho) who can speak English convincingly, even though his accent is Canadian not American, but well forgive that - nothings perfectWhat my rating means:  7+  A watchable drama, but nothing exceptional. Good enough to qualify for the race, but finished with the pack. The sort of thing that promises more than it delivers."

His wife who worked as an attorney prior to their marriage, now resumes her career after a 13 year hiatus. She begins to find her true identity.(Source: AsianWiki)~~ Remake of the American TV series ""The Good Wife"" [2009].","Jeon Do Yeon, Kim Seo Hyung, Lee Won Keun, Nana, Yoo Ji Tae, Yoon Kye Sang",tvN,"As a long-time fan of the American original I had lofty expectations for Korea's remake and am happy to report it did not disappoint. K-TGW is very, very faithful to the source material, and maybe more significantly, it's also not afraid to go its own way. *Many comparisons ahead*.

With regards to plots, K-TGW is a serious stickler to the original in ways that should thrill any Good Wife purist. It's abundantly clear the writers/producers *themselves* are highkey stans for TGW in light of the attention to detail in every reproduction of the original's greatest courtroom hits. 

K-TGW also deserves praise for being a masterclass in pacing. For those unaware, the drama spans *three seasons* of the original within 16 episodes. 16 EPISODES. Yet, by some level 10 sorcery, all major character/relationship arcs are completely cohesive.* Particularly, the transformation of Hyekyung (Alicia Florrick's counterpart) is absolutely seamless. 

(*The one glaring exception is the last act of the finale, which is weirdly ambiguous in a way that seems rushed rather than purposeful.) 

Maybe most importantly, the drama also stays faithful to the bisexuality of Nana's character, which was my #1 priority when I heard news of the remake. 

Where Korean TGW diverges from American TGW is in being a lot less cynical. This isn't a value judgment. I for one like my TV cynical, and I was honestly delighted by the corrosion of Alicia Florrick in the original's later seasons. Others hated it. Many read The Good Wife as a story of female empowerment and were not here for their heroine becoming a bad person and ending up alone. But I don't need female protags to be role models who can """"""represent"""""" every woman. I just need them to have fully realised journeys. 

In that sense, the Korean version takes the story back to its roots. Whereas American TGW built Alicia up and then tore her down, K-TGW portrays the rise of Hyekyung and makes that a self-contained story. The drama also fleshes out a proper redemptive arc to Joongwon that would make his blithely amoral American counterpart Will Gardner roll over in his jewel-encrusted coffin. Speaking of which: Alicia/Will was a tragedy of epic Greek proportions; Hyekyung/Joongwon is not. (Naturally, I was much more ruinously attached to the former. YMMV.) 

Meanwhile, Yoo Jitae's character is both more villainous and more appealing than Peter Florrick has ever been. Let it be known there was never any Peter stan-base to speak of. Yoo Jitae, OTOH, probably deserves one.

I wouldn't necessarily call these changes an improvement per se. A happier story doesn't always equal a better one (just as a more grimdark story =/= more mature). The strength of storytelling is what really matters. 

What K-TGW does, though, it does very well. Whether you're familiar with the source material or not, this is one of the best dramas of 2016."

It wasn't predictable, and there is at least one plot twist that caught me totally by surprise. Well done, show! The characters all have a backstory to tell and all the main actors did a phenomenal job. This show would have gotten higher marks if not for the last couple of episodes. I wasn't happy with some of the decisions the characters made and one the writers made. Also there were quite a few questions left unanswered at the end that really needed to be addressed. 

Kim Young Kwang and Kim Seul Gi were my main draws to this show, and Key was a secondary draw. I've never seen anything with Lee Shi Young, but she was awesome! She is a strong female lead and kicks serious butt in this show. Kim Young Kwang as Jang Do Han is a character that you almost hated, but still loved him in the role because he was owning this character. Kim Seul Gi had great emotional scenes, and Key was adorkable as their resident hacker. I loved how they all came together for a common goal, but developed a bond with each other over the course of the drama. Each one knocked my socks off. 

You really have to pay attention and focus while you watch this - you won't want to miss any detail. The plot, as with most action movies, is convenient for our anti-heroes. But it still keeps you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, hoping the best for them. The story had its flaws, I can't deny, but for the most part I enjoyed this show quite a bit. 

The music was very edgy and well chosen. 

Won't be high on the re-watch as the genre just doesn't lend itself well once you know the outcomes. However, I would recommend this one to action lovers."

Now, it is one of my fav shows of 2018. The Guest is unlike any kdrama I've ever seen before. It's bloody and dark and overall just a really good horror show. They really went all out there with the horror sometimes and it was great. The story, way it was shot, the actors, and the music also worked so well together. Overall it was just a really fun drama to watch. Many people found it difficult to watch because of the horror that was on display. I am very fond of this kind horror, with ghosts and demons and stuff, so I was kind of in my element. I switched off the lights and turned some candles on before (almost) every episode. I had a great time watching it. The story was for the most part very well put together. It started of very strong (and because of that some of the following episodes felt a bit weaker in comparison), but there were a lot of interesting twists and turns in there and some really fun characters. The begrudging collaboration between the three main characters that, along the way, turned into some beautiful friendship was awesome. Often when you thought you knew what was going on, or what was going to happen, the drama managed to twist it just a little bit. There were a few times when a episode ended and I just sat there watching the credits and just going; ""oh, shit.""Some episode were a bit slower than other and sometimes those episodes felt like they were more fillers, especially towards the middle and right before the final episodes rolled around. But you also needed to slow things down from time to time and not have it all action.  But there were also episodes were everything just clicked together and everything had a nice pace to it. The drama isn't perfect. No drama is.There was a time where I felt like we were a bit stuck running around in circles, where there was almost the 'possession of the weak' going on and a lot of the same turns of events were happening and some parts felt a little repetitive, but we were still gathering a lot of new informations and clues while running around those circles, so I did not mind it too much. I don't know if I will ever watch a kdrama quite like The Guest again. It felt like a unique viewing experience, even if the themes of exorcism and all of that arent new to horror movies or shows.

Rather, that guilty secret was used to prompt the actual plot that was about bullying, friendship, redeption and the web of misunderstandings that lead to misbehavior. The performances from all the actors and actresses in the cast were pretty good and helped the drama a lot. However, the first episodes were too awkwardly presented and too rushed. So, six out of ten."

So far this drama is very funny and Im enjoying it. The fish out of water story can either go right or wrong for me. And with the approach being more of a comedy than anything else Im really enjoying that. I need a good feel good drama that isnt taking itself too seriously and with the first two episodes it does that. This drama isnt anything too spectacular, not saying it cant though. The thing I dont like is the female leads character  Kim Dal. She is kind of a sasaeng with the following of this male idol. I dont really buy into the romance if there is one between the two. Its sort of hinted but I dont think Id like it and it wouldnt make sense since this guy is completely different than the idol shes been well.. idolizing. Hopefully shes more of a helper than a lover. This guy so far is the least interested in the world hes put in so I really hope they dont get together like that. The whole backstory of her character is iffy for me.. hopefully they dont make it offensive but there is only so much I can say. I dont buy into the whole idea of a romance forming, that makes this show more dumb. I dont like how she hinders his success by telling him what to do, its her image of the perfect idol. Instead I wish the show would do more of the fish out of water, but in all honesty I think that mind wear itself thin. I like the content of him going  about idol life but doing it in his own unaware way. Kim Dal sucks the fun out of that, and overall sucks the fun from this drama. Thats how it is for me at least. I havent read the webtoon so this is coming from that sort of perspective. Kim Min Gue does a really good job with his role(s). The concept of him being some heavenly figure being put into the real world is working now because of the reactions of other people. Its hilarious this guy Rembrary working his way around not only being a guy in the real world but an idol that is expected to be someone he just isnt. I like his nonchalant attitude and how he doesnt at all know the concept of the idol and also many things about the human world.  And thats the most interesting part for me. So if this drama keeps up with these funny scenarios Id really like it all the way through. The whole plot is so out there so I wish that the writing went all the way with that. Sometimes it takes itself too seriously and thats when I start to get really bored. I REALLY dont want a romance from this drama with the two leads but I guess Im expecting it.  The plot with the devil is so boring. Shows can be engaging in all parts of it, this show isnt engaging with its subplots. I want more of the idol doing promotions, etc. and the reactions of other characters to that. I dont need devil plot being shown as much as it is because I dont understand it nor care because I do not understand it. Its one dimensional villian and Im not watching this show for that much cheap tension. Im watching because of the over the top plot.. maybe I should watch Welcome to Waikiki instead ..Let me emphasize. That if the plot is stupid, at least be funny. It is a funny show without the whole other world plot. The female lead kills the fun, its just getting old after each episode with her draining and draining.The whole plot threads about self hate and suicide or so wrongly interpreted. Especially when you have the devil giving a character depression.. the representation there is used as a plot device and I find it offensive how its done. I hate the Rizzle sub plot, I hate the devil sun plot, I hate the other world sub plot, the cult, I only like the idol fun happy things going on because thats why I started the show in the first place. The mental illnesses arent treated like that , they are to move the plot along and are cheap ways to try and get sympathy. Down to the whole idol life it gets dull. The interesting one was the singing competition and after that it became unbelievably unrealistic yet so cheap and unoriginal. Especially the awards show, there was hardly any build up and it just seemed to happen all at once. Im really impressed by the other idol characters and the writing there with them. The dorm life scenes are fun and his members also play off this new character really well. I can put myself in their perspective because the writing is done with me knowing that they all were a group with the real Woo Yeon Woo. Each episode takes more and more years off my life. This drama is just plain stupid. I cant :("

I could relate to pretty much every character up to episode 9 or 10. Yes, the class system in Korea is harsh, very rich can't marry very poor people, true mostly.Yes, a kind of traumatic childhood can give you trouble in your relationships as an adult, I can relate to that too.And the writers played it out nicely for a while, with the fl and ml doing that 'wanting but can't dance'  - although the 'wanting' side was 95% the ml, and the 'can't' side 99% the fl.I did wonder a little why the fl was quite overreacting for the ml to shortly hesitate when he was late for their first restaurant date. I understood her first angry reaction. But given that she liked him too at that point I did not understand why she would not, at least some days later, and when he apologised for about a thousand times,  - why she then would not even consider it could have had many different reasons why he shortly hesitated. Did he forget to lock something important in the office maybe? Did he feel really unwell or hey, was he maybe scared too? She gives him no credit, won't let him explain and drags this offended diva behaviour to the max. I found her character difficult at that point and my understanding her slowly vanished from that point.But it gets worse. Every single time the ml has enough of her escapades - which are fueled with her steady looking angry blankly and simply not answering any understandable questions, just leaving people standing there like idiots -  it's her luring him in again, giving him some spark of hope with her controversial behaviour. And every single time he bites the bait like a fish, she - vanishes again, or suddenly doesn't talk to him without any explanation. She meanwhile starts some kind of alibi realtionship with the young guardsman who obviously likes her, while she, doesn't really like him but feels reminded of her dead young brother and lives out some trauma coping - I'll give her she might not actively  realise it, but it's what she does.This misery gets even topped when the fl stunts a fake fling with another co-worker, to put everyone off of her. Well, that is rather short sighted as she could instead just have had the courage to break up with the guardsman (who has his own palette of troubles by the way), instead of so deeply hurting and humiliating him with this strange plan.  Also to blame is the co-worker of course, a friend of the ml, who easily destroys his friendship with this stupid stunt. And after that stunt where most of the bank's employees and employers do believe it took place, it gets toxic to the max. So our fl does this stunt to also put off our ml from her - fine. But the next thing she does when he is hurt, and angry, and doesn't want anything to do with her  -she leads him on again, making a scene, with tears and telling him'everybody is badmouthing and hating me and asking me questions and YOU don't even care and don't ask me about it?' Excuse me, WHAT?This is borderline narcissistic behaviour par excellence from her, she wants him away, even pulls this destructive stunt and when he stars hating her - understandably, she blames him for not caring to know why she did all that shit?He falls for it again, follows her home (pretty much every night by the way, which, once again, has this creepy stalking vibe I disliked and criticised in other dramas before), we get an ultracheesy, her sitting in the rain crying, and him bringing the umbrella, both staring at each other quite silly in the pouring rain for an hour. Of course she doesn't only get a sniffle for being in the rain, she gets ill being on the brink of death (or so it seems) with a fever the very next day. Our ml drives to her house again, finds her ill, and totally overdoes it. So he is in Seoul, with a car in front of her house. She of course has no cold meds at home (why ever that is), and he runs like a madman through the city at night to find all pharmacies closed (surprise) until he finds one that is open. Sorry, but why didn't he go by car? And why did he not take ten seconds to use his phone and simply look up which pharmacy near that place has emergency opening that night? This is all pretty nonsensical. So well, he gets about 50 different meds for a sniffle and a little fever, cooks her the expected sick porridge and leaves. She is funnily enough, completely well the nex day and at work and doesn't even care to believably thank him for his caretaking. But, all of a sudden, she gives him high hopes again, asking him out for dinner at the weekend. He bites the bait - once again, already knowing she will leave the company for another branch soon. So, it really happens, they meet for that weekend dinner, he is carefully happy, longingly staring at her, trying to say only the right things, ( he is never really angry even at that point which is very unbelievable) and she is still rather friendly cold towards him, leaving him in his car saying goodbye from outside. And then, it's not even surprising, after all this verbally giving him new hope by saying from now on she will prioritise her luck and her feelings, she - completely vanishes the very next day, her place is empty (however she managed that over night so shortly) she changed her phone number, has resigned from the company and is gone without a trace.So, wow, she is so very toxic, it's almost unbelievable. And I can't excuse all of this because she has some childhood trauma, as many people have and don't act out like that steadily. I wouldn't even mind that much if she would just be cold towards everyone including our ml, because she is just not able to have any relationship. But she plays it out once and again, everytime he starts getting away from her for being hurt yet another time, she drags him in again, and even asking him to give her compliments, to tell her once again how much he likes her etc. it's quite unbearable to watch it. But don't get me wrong, the ml is not any better. Although being at least 40 or older, he is using another woman too who really likes him, almost  marrying her although he knows he simply has no feelings for her. I also understood that to some point but shortly after he was just a coward not breaking up with her completely as he obviously knows how painful it is for her that she can't do anything for him to like her. As mentioned before I do ask myself with some male drama characters why they always have to have these stalking tendencies. It is not normal to follow a woman home pretty much every night, standing in front of her house, spying from corners on what she is doing and whom she is talking to. I also aks myself does he not have any other things in life? Does he not have friends, family meetings, hobbies? All we see is him at work drooling after the FL and watching her every step, and after work following her home like a stalker. Also thinking about his age, experience in life, and looks, I simply don't believe he would be lead on like a 15 year old hormone-ridden school boy after all the things the fl does through the episodes. I just don't believe it.And on top of that, since episode 10, everything is dragging in total slow motion. I don't know why, but it seems like the writers simply couldn't find a way to sensibly fill 16 episodes, so especially ep 13 and 14 are a total drag, with scenes drawn to the max and nothing happening, flashbacks we've seen 5 times before or even scenes that kind of took place before (our ml and the other woman breaking up with her crying for what feels like the 10th time). Altogether I have the problem I had several times with other dramas which started promising: I don't like any of the characters. So, as I have watched 14 episodes already, I will watch the last two episodes too, maybe fast forwarding, just to see what kind of unbelievable end the writers have thought about.Result: good idea, good start and development and then it goes down the drain."
The Jingbirok: A Memoir of Imjin War,,,48287,2015.0,2015.0,50,,,,"The drama will be a telling of historical events with the scholar as the central character. Ryu Seong Ryong was an official who served during King Seon Jo’s reign in the late 16th century. He was a brilliant Confucian scholar who was put in charge of military operations during the Imjin War, and greatly influenced Admiral Lee Soon Shin. The story starts before the Imjin War begins and will follow the characters all the way through the Battle of Noryang, and the death of Lee Soon Shin.","An So Jin, Han Ji Wan, Jung Tae Woo, Kim Sang Joong, Kim Tae Woo, Lee Kwan Hoon",KBS1,"This drama is 100% politics but I loved every minute of it. It's a tragic memoir of the Imjin war. I loved Ryu Seong Ryung & Lee Soon Shin - they were my favorites on this drama (and their close companions). I liked Gwanghae during the first half but by the second half I was disappointed with his actions... :/
A great drama however, if you don't mind watching one that has zero romance. I cried a few times while watching it and cried at the end too :'( It's more sad b/c you basically see history take place before your eyes :'(

This drama follows the writings left by Ryu Seong Ryung about the Imjin War that he titled 'Jing Bi Rok' - and we watch this unfold before our eyes, the invasion of the Japanese army, the fights in the court, the actions of King Seonjo as he tries to hold onto his power and suspects everyone. The righteous leading of Ryu Seong Ryung & his followers, the Bravery & Heart of Lee Soon Shin, the anger of Prince Gwanghae, the secret ""peace talks"" between Wae & Ming, the deception of the envoys, the patriotic spirits of the Righteous armies, the punishment brought out by Seonjo b/c of his fear of praise being taken away from him....the Japanese internal struggle with each other, and Toyotomi's crazy greed for power. 

Ryu Seong Ryung is a character I admired throughout the entire drama & I respected anyone who followed him & believed in him. Lee Soon Shin a man who no matter who asked what of him would only do what he felt was right - he never brought harm to his men. He was upright, brave, unyielding and strong of heart - another man to be greatly admired - without him who knows what would have happened in history... I loved his friendship with Ryu Seong Ryung ^^ Both of these men are so brave - they go so well together - definitely the best of friends <3 While watching King Seonjo all I could do was shake my head at his childish, and petty ways.... and there were several other great characters throughout the drama :)

Actors I have to give a shoutout to:
~ Kim Sang Joon (Ryu Seong Ryung), Kim Suk Hoon (Lee Soon Shin), Kim Tae Woo (King Seonjo), Jung Tae Woo (Cheon Ri), Choi Chul Ho (Lee Hang Bok), Noh Young Hak (Prince Gwanghae), Lee Kwan Hoon (Shin Myeong Chul), Nam Sung Jin (Lee Deok Hyeong), & Jeon Kwang Jin (Song Hee Rib) ~

I for one would re-watch this drama if time allowed. If you like historicals - especially factual based historicals then you should enjoy this one as we watch history unfold. 

The only OST I remember is just an instrumental that came on at the beginning and during the drama - nothing spectacular but it fit very well with this drama."

However, as it happens sometimes, this is one of those reviews that are based solely on personal enjoyment rather than merit.You see, K2 is like this beautiful vase; it has intricately exotic designs on the outside but its inside is completely hollow and littered with cobwebs. Now, it's up to you whether you want to put it on a shelf and admire its surface beauty or you want to break it into a billion pieces and consequently end up being utterly disappointed by its stark reality. If you're a person who can momentarily cast aside rationale in the face of glitz and glamour, K2 and you would get along just fine but the moment you stop, tilt your head to the side and think; ""wait a minute""  all possibilities of friendship are out the door.K2 is almost reckless in its execution, as if it reached a point where logic just didn't matter anymore. It took blatantly unrealistic happenings, a gigantic cluster of plotholes and downright ridiculous notions and attempted to create a story out of them. It's almost like the creators are poking fun at the audience as if they were idiots blanketed in foolish naivete. Events transpire without any build up, there is little to no attention to detail and honestly, it's a huge fast-paced mess.This drama is like an arrogant brat who does whatever the fuck it wants, confident that it would be successful, still. A woman in Iraq who's completely covered in a gown and headscarf at all times, without any second thought decides to cast aside her veil and liplock with her hero just because he suggested they should marry. The same woman is somehow extremely fluent in Korean language (even though she has lived all her life in Iraq) and Korean pop culture (even though she's in the middle of nowhere) and conveniently is killed to produce a motive for our male lead to enter the action. A girl who's had extreme Sociophobia all her life, is suddenly very confidently striking poses with groups of people in the next second. A man who essentially hates power hungry murderers is shown to sympathize with a woman who is exactly that, if not more. There are so many handy plot devices just waiting to pop out from all sides at the very last moment in order to somehow save and prolong the show and it's all quite satirical.But ofcourse, the smartarse that K2 is; it's completely in the know of all of its flaws and has the audacity to give justifications. The woman could speak Korean so well because she had been taught to be a translator. The girl never had Sociophobia, she just pretended because she didn't want to interact with people. The man didn't feel anything for the murderer, nope, that was just means to an end. And so, K2 commits many crimes and yet, makes sure to cover all the evidence.The flow of the story, with all of its nonsensical and out of the blue events, is stroppy at best. Many things are left unanswered and this is the kind of production that will have you shake your head with amused exasperation at every second of its antics.However, despite all this, for me this was a classic case of ""it's so bad that it's good"" and I somehow ended up thoroughly enjoying myself.Jee Chang Wook has proved his excellent acting skills numerous of times and here too, he delivered impeccably. Unfortunately for him, he wasn't given much substance to deliver in the first place. His character is unbelievably overpowered, able to survive situations where even a super human ninja would've been obliterated. He has a butter heart, a hero complex and is very motivated to save the world one distressed damsel at a time. Combine that with JCW's natural mixture of masculinity and boyish arrogance and you get a specimen that is too good to be true. And when things are too good to be true, they mostly take a turn for the worse.It's painfully obvious that the show is highly monetizing on his looks and name; for most of the show is him being either shirtless, flaunting his abs or doing something similarly badass to establish his ""coolness"". So if you're here to judge JCW's acting this is the last drama you should go to.As far as I am concerned though, I really didn't care either way. For me, simply watching him is a pleasure, he's my ultimate bias killer and hey, if the producers want to shove mindless fanservice (involving him) down my throat, I ain't complaining.Yoona turned out to be a pleasant surprise. She's built to play the helpless heroine who always needs saving, who trusts way too easily, cries even easier and basically creates hindrances for everyone around her. The show really tried to suppress her in every possibly way, they didn't give her character a single moment to shine and did everything they could to make her appear helpless and pathetic. However, somehow Yoona managed to turn the tables. Instead of pity, Anna garners sympathy and I would be lying if I said I wasn't rooting for her. There's an intelligence in her eyes that no matter how much of a putz she was portrayed to be, she still succeeded in speaking with the viewers and maintaining a likable character throughout.And now comes Song Yoon ah- the heart and soul of the show. What an absolutely brilliant actress. She's one of the best k-drama antagonists; utterly ruthless and cruel and yet harboring deep vulnerabilities. She's a viciously dangerous woman and yet, pitiful at times. She's the most layered character of the show and even though she insists upon it, it's almost impossible to truly hate her.As far as the romance is concerned, even though it's rushed and underdeveloped, there's no denying that Ji- Chang Wook can create chemistry with a garbage bag, if you let him. And if I'm being completely honest, I enjoyed the lovey dovey bits to the fullest. (Aww-ing and Ooh-ing was involved.)So finally the question arises: If K2 on the whole, has so many shortcomings, why give it an 8.5 rating? Well, in answer to that I'll say, that I just had too much fun watching it. Plain and simple. For me, it was unadulterated amusement- sometimes at its ridiculousness and sometimes at its unabashed negligence. I anticipated every episode and was fully immersed from start to finish.The K2 is like greasy junk food, you know it can't possibly amount to anything good but you still can't help devouring. With brilliant action scenes, beautiful visuals, entrancing music and a gorgeous cast that actually knows how to act, it is the perfect cheat meal.Hate it or love it, you'd still end up watching it to the last episode and as far as the drama is concerned- that's a mission well accomplished.A delectable guilty pleasure, so why not indulge? Enjoy!"

Its such a weird mix of genres and tropes, but somehow it works perfectly. You get yourself a crime murder mystery, slice of life with some deep and meaningful moments and conversations, comedy that at times is rather dark, and in other scenes slapstick and over the top. It might seem like a silly comedy at first, but it gets dark closer to the end. The whole story is led by a genius idiot Ahn Dae Seong. He is what I would call a smart person who is unable to make smart life decisions. How can anyone have such a strong brain power, but still be so street dumb is beyond me, but it works in this scenario extremely well. That said, he is actually a truly nice and genuine person. He apologizes when he does something wrong, works hard if he thinks the cause is worth it, and he cares for people in his life. Even though he might make everyone frustrated, its hard not to like him and not to root for him. The supporting cast is also to die for. Well written and built personal stories and backgrounds with well placed hints made each one of them a perfect suspect, until we found out the truth. Its hard to predict who the killer is (at least for the first half of the show) and why they do it. As I watched, I might have felt frustrated with how Dae Seong is suspicious and calls everyone a suspect, but when you look at it from his perspective, everyone was in fact acting suspicious, just for vastly different reasons than he assumed. From all the supporting characters, Fish was my favorite. Truly adorable little potato, knew it from the start. They also have one of the more powerful and interesting back stories of them all, that is presented in a sensible manner. Of all the characters, the one that annoyed me was the detective and 5dollar, but I still understood where they were coming from. Dae Seong truly did everything he could to seem like a potential killer, and literally no one in that neighborhood was helping with the real investigation. And from 5dollar view, he might have seen himself as a victim, no matter how twisted it might seem from our perspective. That said, even though I truly enjoyed the premise and many side stories, I feel like at times they tried to do too much in too little time. Since everyone was presented as a potential suspect, they all had to have their own individual stories told to explain the circumstantial evidence. Since the number of supporting characters was high, some stories were bound to get less screen time and felt more like fillers. Since some were not explored enough, they got a little bit boring for me, as I was not that engaged in them. Yet somehow, they were able to give a perfect closure for all presented plot lines.There were also some situations that I questioned why the characters had barely any reaction to, and took barely any actions to solve them. The last thing that was a bit unsatisfying was the reveal who the killer was. While for the most part it was not easy to predict who it might be (since everyone seemed equally suspicious), when all suspects started to be proven innocent, all hints pointed in one direction so the suspense died. I was truly positively surprised by the acting too. Lee Kwang Soo brings a comedic aspect to everything he does, its hard to deny it. I was quite scared it would be impossible to create any suspense and a more serious mood when he is on screen and I was completely wrong. He aced the emotional scenes. I actually liked his more serious takes more than the silly comedy ones. Kim Seol Hyun shined the most closer to the end. In the first half of the show, her character seemed a bit like a plot device, but it all led to quite a prominent role in the later episodes. All the cast members did their best to present realistic and relatable characters, and for me, they all delivered. Ahn Se Bin as Yul? Amazing performance for a child actress, especially with such a demanding role!Production value was extremely high for a mini series like that. Aesthetic wise, it had a bit of a retro vibe. Not making it look like a big production was a good choice, since it fits the world building - all happening in a small neighborhood with just a few characters - it should feel familiar. I have to say, one song from the OST gave me chills when it was  first played - Nokdus Orange Dream. From the arrangement, instrumentation, vocals, to the lyrics, it truly is a perfection. It serves as a good introduction to Dae Seong as a character - someone stuck in the past glory, dreams and hopes, who is unable to move on. The whole OST was lit and extremely fitting every scene specific songs were played for. Overall, such a surprisingly good watch. I expected nothing, and got more than I could receive even if I had rather high hopes."

Gone are the days when KBS and MBC used to produce daeha (80 to 100 episode sageuks about kings) so this 32-episode series is all we're going to get for now, and each episode has to be savoured, digested, and ruminated in full.The story about Prince Lee Bang Won isn't new and we've seen many versions over the years. Each drama has its own interpretation of King Taejong/Prince Lee Bang Won and his motivations or the circumstances which drove him to take the actions he took. Like a familiar opera, the story here isn't important; it's watching the acting of stellar and experienced actors performing at their best. In this regard, this drama does well. The actors are all skilled crafts people, even the younger actors who acted as the princes. The only trivia I'll offer is that Kim Yong Chul who plays Yi Seong Gye (King Taejo) in this as well as My Country: The New Age in 2019.However, the drama got off to a rough start when the production was embroiled in a scandal over animal rights. The infamous scene had the production team effectively trip a horse to make it throw the rider. Social media harshly deride it as animal cruelty as the horse eventually died. The drama was pulled off the air for about 6 weeks and the remaining episodes were in jeopardy (hence the relatively low overall ratings?) but ultimately it prevailed.After the drama resumed, it portrayed a seemingly vengeful and paranoid King Taejong as he killed his enemies or perceived enemies to cement his power.  Watch this only if you're a consummate history buff. It is relatively fast moving for a sageuk as unlike other daehas which comes in 50 to 100+ episodes this ends at 32. It is a refreshing change from yet another love story of young love (yawn)."
The King of the Desert,,,7005,2022.0,2022.0,6,,,,Tells the story of people who believe that money is everything and people who believe that money is not everything.(Source: Korean = Naver || Translation = MyDramaList) ,"Jang Dong Yoon, Jin Goo, Jung Yi Seo, Kim Jae Hwa, Lee Soon Won, Yang Dong Geun",,"""But there must be a reason behind it all""  ""Do you want me to teach you how to be good at work? Don't ask yourself: Why?''. I think this whole show was a commentary on how we stay in the well known patterns, even if they are not productive, simply because things have always been this way or they bring us monetary gratification. But why do we even care so much about money? Because this is what society tells us is important. A vicious circle of bullshit. Trying to suggest change is scary, and since everyone accepts the current state, it means it's working so why would anyone even try to challenge it? Everyone cannot be wrong, it's more likely I don't understand why it's like that. Stuff like the Milgram experiment or Asch Conformity Experiment explain it well. Both good examples how awful people are at going against:1. Authority2. Groups of people.And if you add actual reward (money) for the conformity, people will do a great type of mental gymnastics to justify the current state. Like drawing the circles, then erasing them and doing the same with x, just because the boss said you have to do it. I'm sure many of us did things we knew were pointless, but they were orders we just had to do. You can think you are not part of the problem, but you most likely are. Not to the same extent as the characters in the show, since everything was over exaggerated, but as long as we participate in the society, we do stupid things for the sake of some kind of benefit - money, popularity, recognition from strangers. But why do we care? Each episode presents us with different takes on what one can sacrifice for money: pride, self-esteem, time, family, morality. It also shows what we truly want - connection, love, freedom, a feeling of belonging, self-worth.The show opens with the best episode, so keep that in mind. On one hand it sets up the story well, but it also makes the remaining episode have less impact. Each short story is connected to each other, even though they changed the main character. Personally, my favorite episodes were Dancing on the sand and Family Vacation. Both had strong messages that resonated with me and my experience. The production and the acting were phenomenal. Truly would not change a detail. The short duration of the episodes (most were a bit over 20 minutes) made the show more digestible and left some room for interpretation and reflection for the viewers. I feel like depending on your own life experience, perspective and expectations, you will see something else in each and every story. Overall, great watch, but not for everyone. Its weird and symbolic. While on the surface the overall message is easy to understand, there is far more than what people will do for money if you start digging deeper. Its also an impactful watch if you are willing to reflect on how the messages fit into how you are handling your life."

Screenwriter  Han Hee Jung and director Song Hyun Wooks  The Kings Affection  attempted to offer viewers the best of two worlds; a Sageuk ( historical drama) and an arguably  more  modern love story. However against its more intriguing setup  The Kings Affection found itself shoehorned into a slow-paced trope extravaganza by the second-half. Han Hee Jungs facilitated writing techniques  in the  first-half of the series seemed to indicate towards foundational world-building and characters- rough around the edges with mystique driving forward many of the characters, but still establishing an intriguing storyline. However whilst Han Hee Jungs first-part soared with potentiality  the actuality of the latter-half gradually began to descend into a cataclysmic attempt to keep the plot interesting- uninspiring  plot twists led little time to truly develop more intriguing characters whilst seemingly paramount plot lineups were given an anticlimactic or loose-end outcome.  Of course a director or screenwriter choosing to convey modern twists or themes in a historical drama isnt always necessarily a  bad thing. It can give opportunities to highlight  or echo current issues,  themes  which are still present in todays world and present different takes on the past through the director/ screenwriters objectives. However whilst it was easy to understand  The Kings Affection desired depiction  of  different forms of love, it often felt as though the series would rarely touch upon more prominent issues of the time and today ( e.g. gender expectations, political division in society, social status and prejudice)  in more depth. This often resulted in  the second-half of the series feeling like a composed accumulation of romantic tropes and cliches against a gradually decadent  plot-drive by the final episodes . Main actress Park Eun Bin undeniably offered one of the strongest performances of the series; adding an air of charm  to her onscreen counterpart. The female lead Dami was undeniably the epitome of the  inserted and frequently-used cross-dressing trope by having to play the role of her brother l the Crowned Prince Lee  throughout most of the events of the series . Whilst  with   plot context it was necessary for  driving  the storyline, there were a lot of loose threads considering other story points including exactly why her grandfather ordered her to be killed ( aside from merely just being an  unnecessary girl), as well as  one evident  fact; the female leads feminine features and vocal intonations are evident even as her male counterpart . Admittedly whilst this may have just been passed off by members of the royal court it did hit a point blank in plot logic when many scenes and close-ups easily giving  away Park Eun Bins softer features.  Later episodes did little to truly allow Dami to come to terms with these cut-out subplots surrounding her storyline, ultimately reducing her seemingly intriguing character-drive to the equivalent of cannon fodder by the latter-half.Costarring alongside Park Eun Bin is idol-actor Rowoon. Rowoons performance as main lead Jung Ji Woon did undeniably see some surprisingly bittersweet performance moments as his onscreen persona comes to terms with his sexuality and growing feelings for the Prince, as well as his initial motives for entering the palace. However  Ji Woons initial establishment as the  mysterious tutor is subverted in later episodes to the  lovelorn sweetheart; pledging his own  life to  protecting Hwi ( despite his initial reasons early on in the series) and benignly chasing after the femaleleads affections in a dragged-out and anticlimactic love story. This often resulted in a test of patience for viewers as Ji Woon and Hwis sense of gradual chemistry and growth was shoehorned into a lacklustre onscreen relationship despite dominant screen time.As a consequence of lacking development time potentially intriguing characters such as Lee Hyun-Hwis protective cousin ( Nam Yoon Su), the Princes mysterious bodyguard ( Choi Byung Chan), Shin So Eun - the daughter of the Minister of Interior ( Bae Yoon Kyung) and Noh Ha-Kyung; the youngest daughter of the Minister of War ( Jung Chae Yeon) were often enforced into staid plot setups and cliches with their character arcs and drives often being cut short.The cinematography and OST of the series could admittedly vary from scene to scene. Whilst there were some admittedly beautiful shots and powerful soundtracks combined with scenes of the palace and period outfits presented by director Song Hyun Wook, more subtle emotions and scenes  could often feel lacklustre from poorly-placed camera angles and song choices onscreen. So what is left to say about  The Kings Affection? Is it worth watching or is it a waste of time? The  Kings Affection is the epitome of a  hot mess series - stunning outfits, an intriguing premise, a fairly good cast lineup   and an especially dynamic performance from main actress Park Eun Bin undeniably remained the dramas greatest takeaways. However the twenty-episode formula applied to a storyline which was written  better for no more than  sixteen- episodes, created a slow-moving and disengaging second-half for viewers with intriguing subplots and characters left in the background in order to make way for a lacklustre romance which gradually dwindled to an unsurprisingly anticlimactic resolution. Overall whilst the 20-episode drama whilst not unwatchable and certainly decent enough if you are willing to watch out of sheer boredom, it does admittedly lack a more definitive spark of feeling well-rounded also."

Don't be confused. This is not a 7 first kisses sequel, it was not supposed to be an advertisement drama special..the moment the production decided to add more lines for the product placement than the plot/character development was the moment they threw away the viewers worth. honestly I don't think I've ever seen a drama so bluntly advertise their sponsored products this much. ""I've never found this fried chicken outside of korea"", ""this makes my skin moist"", ""this boosts your stamina"", ""this mask is a best seller"" and blah blah blah ;/ if anything they made me want to buy those products even less.one of their biggest problem was how they show you an event like ep11's over dramatic ending and then the next ep they start from a pre setup and repeat everything again and get to the point only halfway through the ep. (that's not how cliffhangers work)the lines were so cheesy and cringe worthy it was embarrassing, and the acting from the 2 mains was mediocre and the only reason it was acceptable was becasue everything else sucked.the romance lacked substance and it was too rushed that it made it seem like taeul only loved yigon's money. they had zero on screen chemistry and no amount of neck kisses (which was just 1) could save their so called love.speaking of kisses, they start with the cliche open eyed fish kiss, gave 1 neck kiss and went back to ""covering their face with a hand or something"" so it looks like they're kissing but it was obvious they were not ;D and I don't personally care for kissing scenes since they don't add to the romance but enhance it, and so if the actors feel uncomfortable having more than 1 kiss they shouldn't be forced into it.the plot was a literal zero. an empty flashy mess of a story. nothing was consistent, nothing made sense and nothing was explained.this is what happens when the writer gets a deal to make their drama after only writing the 1st couple of eps, it was obvious she only had the start idea and the end (which was a total cheap move full of fan service) so she was lost most of the time.now the directors all take the other part of the blame. the switching between the 2 worlds was so bad that no one could tell which world they were in until someone's name was mentioned ;/the audios were always such a mess, the chewing were too loud and every sound felt artificial, like ep11's footsteps. it felt like a zombie apocalypse..they had so many side plots and characters unrelated to the main plot that it was hard to know who was who and what purpose they held, but worse part was that nothing was explained and thus they were just fillers..everything big and flashy uncle evil seemed to work towards was pointless. he looked scary and evil but was caught in 1second, they talked big of time stopping but it never became an issue..so to sum it up we had 1 ep of plot, 14 eps of fillers and angst and 30min of resolution followed by 55min of fan service~as if the 2 worlds was not confusing enough they had to add time traveling, but alas how else would they have had saved their empty black hole mess of a plot?Jo Young / Jo Eun Sub and Myung Na Ri / Myung Seung Ah were the highlight of the show for me, both as actors and as characters so I'm incredibly disappointed by the wasted potential. they could've had 2 more couples in this and increased the level of uwu but anyway, the Jos and the Myungs had better chemistry and more believable love lines and though I was happy with their end, I was again disappointed that they didn't really show them together much...young was such a cold, professional no nonsense kind of a guy but his social life (shown only as laptop sticker -I wonder whose idea was that) and his interactions with both eunsub and their puppy twins showed how much more of a sweet warmhearted person he was.

A web comic served as a template.Nonetheless. For all its playful wit, it is also a production that has its serious moments as well. In the background wafts an ugly (as usual) Jaebeol mess at the expense of the honest simple people. In the foreground, the protagonist fights for the rights of ordinary people with a lot of passion, intelligence, courage and the active support of old and new friends as well as her (after all) love interest. The legal cases dealt with are close to everyday sorts of topics and provide an up-to-date overview of perennial issues such as bullying, child abuse, sloppiness in construction, etc.The idea of setting up a Law Cafe away from the usual law firm business is unique. There visitors can get professional legal advice in addition to barista coffee in a comfy atmosphere. All of the characters are originals, and their quirks and idiosyncrasies are cheerfully staged here and there. You can literally feel the underlying comic.The focus is on the 'four-dimensional' personality of Kim Yu-ri. (4D in Korean standards means a particularly eccentric, freaky, quite special character. 4D is generally considered a compliment, especially in the teen and KPop milieu.) She meets the ingenious, former public prosecutor Kim Jeong-ho, her school friend from back then and also son of a rich family. He lately indulges in idleness, enjoys his life in tracksuits - as a writer and real estate owner. There's some harmlessly sweet, romantic flirtation of the Korean decent kind, but also concentrated intelligence and creativity in solving some intricate cases. The evil, powerful business bosses and their crazy doings find an appropriate expression in the phrenetically perfidious, exalted, almost insane boss of the Dohan construction company.Bottom line: You can look forward to a spicy mixture of fun and seriousness. To a love story. To a cast in good mood. To lively entertainment. However, I have to admit that 2 (sometimes 4) episodes a week was quite enough for me. I could easily wait for the new episodes. Thus, I wouldn't call the KDrama gripping. It is rather shrewed and witty in places. Rather harmless. However, it is not completely banal. Overall, special care was taken to ensure that everyone in the audience understood the seriousness of the legal cases being dealt with. The deliberately sincere, almost missionary approach to e. g. the topic of sexism and ""Yes means Yes"" is remarkable. The KDrama obviously wants to be more than just good entertainment. And I think that the production succeeds in this mission quite well: A rom+com K-Drama, derived from a comic, that gently but firmly grabs society by the collar, in a good mood and optimistically presenting creative ways, how despite all the existing corruption business surrounding the machinations of the powerful, justice could actually be possible. It wouldn't be due to the law, because that would at least actually be available..."

Touching. Plus light-heartedly questioning the matter of course of human interaction  ""The Legend of the Blue Sea"" refers to a very old Korean legend that originally tells the lovestory between a mermaid and a fisherman. However, the KDrama is just loosely based on this fairy tale.In the rich Korean folklore of ""Imuldam"" (mostly oral shamanic songs, myths, fairy tales and folk tales) which is still very much alive today, there are frequently supernatural beings that move around in the earthly dimension - whether mermaids, a nine-tailed fox, a Goblin, or other spirits. These ""Imuldam"" are particularly inspired by shamanism and Buddhism. KDramas repeatedly pick up motifs from this tradition and find contemporary ways to keep them alive and reinterpret them. The special attraction arises from the fact that our human world receives a different value, appreciation and perspective through the eyes of those non-human creatures less influenced by time and space.""The Legend of the Blue Sea"" is based on a mermaid caught in a net by a fisherman in the early Joseon era. Then he fell in love with her. However, mermaids rarely feature in Korean folklore otherwise. The topic makes a nice link to western tradition and that's probably how it was intended. Also, parts of the KDrama play outside of South Korea - in Spain.At the same time, the story takes up another, widespread and popular motif in KDrama orbit: reincarnation. Most of the time it is about souls that were not able to complete certain experiences in the past and are confronted with these or similar situations again in their present incarnation - in order to do things better or differently. In ""The Legend of the Blue Sea"", the historical fairy tale from back then and its version, transposed into the present day, are developed in parallel in two narrative threads. Just as the protagonist (and also another character) slowly (again) remember their past life, we, too, experience what really happened back then. Eventually the question arises whether life must necessarily repeat itself or else other decisions could be made.Actress Jun Ji-hyun obviously enjoys her character as a humorous, mischievous mermaid, innocently and ignorantly experiencing the modern human world. With her performance she definitely jazzes the story up. Her sometimes almost naive trust, which is a bit reminiscent of a puppy in places, stands in warming contrast to the distanced, calculating coolness of her Jack of Hearts in 2017. The picture is completed by - here and there - being able to look back into their Joseon past, where he rather personifies an amorous, honorable nobleman.Ultimately, this KDrama offers a well-designed dramaturgical variety of telling an enchanting love story in two different ways - and at the same time (with a twinkle of an eye) questioning the matter of course of human habits and interaction.Its fun and touching."

I thought I'd make it to be the first one to write this review but oh well :D 

Honestly, the only reasons why I became interested in this drama was the original manga and that Joy from Red Velvet was the female lead. I don't typically watch musical dramas because they can become very cheesy real fast and the music could get on your nerves. However, the major thing that I found lacking the most was a powerful OST. Since it's a drama based on music and the entertainment world, I would've loved the variety of amazing and touching songs and occasional appearances of Kpop stars.
The story itself was quite lovely and light. I could the storyline being nicely fitted into a fresh anime, since it has that type of shoujo genre vibe. I was missing some characters' backstories, more screen time for the secondary couple please! 
I thought that the casting was appropriate, moreover, I found some brilliant new actors to stalk... Also, the second lead syndrome was real, rooted for Chan Yeong oppa all the way~~~
Briefly, it's a fluffy and a lighthearted drama to watch if you're a music or a fan of the manga. Don't expect too much though since it's quite generic and predictable."

Does it matter how good of an idea you have if you surround it with bullshit?By episode 9 I suspected where the drama was going, but some scenes did not make any sense with my prediction. It would make the characters look too dumb, so I dropped that idea. Guess what... it did happen at the end. By episode 13 I figured out the biggest plot twist and it just got me angry, because it made no sense. And I'm not some genius for figuring it out. The writing was just predictable.As for the characters, some were great, some were bad, some barely existed. I definitely enjoyed the detectives team, and the investigation aspect was my favorite part of the show. Jin Kyung and Ho Gyu stole my heart and became my favorites. Jo Tae Shik was your typical hero cop, and if it was not for Lee Min Ki's acting, I would not pay that much attention to him.The biggest let down? Kim Seo Hui. She just never learned from any of her mistakes, jeopardizing the investigation too many times to count. For the majority of the show she had nothing to do. I am quite honestly convinced this drama could have been more or less the same even if we write her off completely. If you ask me, she should be relegated to supporting character and her image should have never been used in posters.The big bad wolf was boring and obvious, but then it's not like they tried to hide it. I did enjoy Dong Gu quite a lot though. His desperation was interesting to watch and I wished we had seen more of him on the screen. Other shady characters were... there doing shady things? I don't know. I hated how there were excuses and explanations made for some bad characters, but not others, when  they were all equal  trash.Overall, this could have been so good. There were some episodes I actually enjoyed a lot. The dynamics between detectives was gold, the rivalry between Dong Gu and Young Min was exciting, but then they ruined it all with some really cheap and lazy writing and directing choices that I just couldn't ignore."

Yes, the message is beautiful and all, and yes, that last episode had me crying, but I can't say whether that's because of the writing or my feelings towards Alzheimer's after experiencing it through my grandmother.And, while the message is important, I would have cared so much more if I knew going into this drama what it was about. Sure there are some people who would choose not to watch it because it is a heavy topic that affects many people in real life. When someone has Alzheimer's, its effects radiate. It affects their family, their friends. It even showed as much in the drama. But the choice of whether or not to watch it should be theirs to make. For some people, dramas are an escape from the hardships of the day. They go into dramas wanting to forget real life and to instead invest in characters that they get to slowly learn and care for. So if they go in wanting an escape, it could be considered cruel to throw away the story they developed over 10 episodes for a topic that hits close to home for many. At the same time, I do understand what they were trying to do and respect that. I'm just not sure I agree with the implementation of it.If the show was honest from the start, I may have loved it. But it wasn't. It feels like those 10 episodes weren't needed if this was the story they were going to tell. All of those story threads and all of that time invested to get to that point were just thrown away in favour of a slice of life melodrama. The show made me care about the delusion of Joon Ha, and I just didn't care at all for the real him because of it. The fake versions of the main couple were a lot more compelling to watch, and I really did care about them, no matter how absurd the story around them was. It's a kdrama, I'm used to the absurd. But the reality of them just made me numb to it all. When I should have felt the most and been hit the hardest, I didn't feel it. A part of me regrets watching it.And yet, at the same time, I respect the premise. I think that Alzheimer's should be talked about and discussed more often, especially since early intervention is very important for treatment. But I don't think this story pulled that off as well as it could have. Judging from the polarizing reaction to it, while some appreciated the message, a lot are just upset at wasting their time.So I'm torn on whether to recommend this or not. I do feel that the surprise is unnecessary, and that going into it understanding what you're going to find at the end is the best approach. You can't be disappointed if you know what's coming, so go into it with an open mind and steel your heart."

It's a 120 episodes drama so there bound to be lots of side characters storyline too. In my case, I don't care for them and I fast forwarded most of the side characters storyline.

I don't know if it's because this is the second K drama I had ever watched and thus I feel quite fond of it or because this is the only drama I've found till now that debates on relationships so openly. Even so, this drama is one of the best for me and a must see, if you want to spend a quiet afternoon watching it. The main story is about an apartment building and it's residents, a newly wed couple, two roommates, an unmarried couple who lives together and a woman who's dating a younger man. Each episode is focused on different stories that, most of the times, end in one episode or two. I liked that this drama was so open about the relationships, as it was free of those taboos (there was even a gay couple). The humour was plenty, with the jokes very entertaining without being silly. And for me, that dirty- innocent humour is the main reason why I love this drama. Most of the dramas you can find are about one main story, but the lover is more about laughter, a true comedy rather than romance, even though you'll find yourselves routing for the couples. The performances must be considered for the success of the comedy part, as the actors were a delight. Now, the soundtrack wasn't the best, but good enough. So, 9 out of 10."

I felt that theme in this drama. If you are a wrestling fan and or fans of Joo Sang Wook or Kim Sun Ah that might just be enough to get you through this drama.  The first 12 episodes seemed only because of Joo Sang Wook that I was able to get through. I did eventually get into this drama and root for the characters and all that but it was a long process.

My thoughts on why. I think in this particular drama. It seemed that like this was a poorly put together drama. The directors got this in reverse. It felt that they got well known actors first and just threw together a story and plot. It felt like the names was all that mattered and we will figure out a plot later...Just what I felt as I a watched this. lol. It did work for the most part because I did watch it through because of  Joo Sang Wook and I did like the finished product, It wasnt a total waste of time. But I usually finish dramas that I start no matter how I might dislike them.

Acting - of course Joo Sang Wook is great and Kim Sun Ah fans may love
I also always like dramas that Jun Kwang Ryul plays the villain. He makes a compelling villain!

We don't even get to know Namjoo that well, she is just someone obssesed with boys, doesn't even seem to have a job or anything. The other male characters have more depth to them, but acting is lacking a bit so it's hard to root for anyone really. The male friend was the most likeable one to me, as the male lead was.. just there. I don't know if he was directed to emote that way, but I just didn't feel much chemistry between him and the female lead.To me the main highlight of this webdrama was Eunjoo's father. It's easy to overact when your character is so larger than life but the actor really pulled it off. I liked his scenes a lot, he added a lot to the series.Last episode ended with a cliffhanger, so I guess we might get a second season?

In ruthless directness, the viewers are confronted with what many people (all over the world) might at some point face in one way or another. The family here is not particularly rich and not particularly poor. The individual protagonists are not particularly successful and have not particularly failed. Everyone lives their (South Korean) life as best they can. Not very happy and not very unhappy. With a tendency not to not be so happy. But they are actually not really unhappy either. In fact, everything could be quite nice, but everyone is just too busy with themselves. The WE becomes self-evident and rather annoying... until the day the finitude of being was knocking on the door...However, hello-wake-up does not imply everyone starts reinventing themselves, overcoming their weaknesses and becoming better people. It does, however, force them to reflect on what they have and what they have forgotten (to love) (consciously) despite everything being taken for granted. In stumbling everyone is searching for an expression of their own feelings. At least they try to be a little bit more alert about what is going on in their life.Very humane. Tangible. Touching, yet not maudlin. Pretty close to life. People are clumsy, speechless and helpless, as akward as it gets.

A story written with the blood of latest Joseon history. Highly valuable.  Definitely worthwile! ""Nokdu Flower"" offers a historically remarkable epic with a strong performance. The KDrama excels sort of. It almost seems as if the entire team was all too aware of the ambitious challenge to adequately capturing this short but crucial sequence of Korean history.In the second half of the 19th century, exploitation, famine, a corrupt, incompetent government and weak kings had eroded almost all belief in the existing system, in aristocracy and administration. Then there was the opening of the country to world politics and trades, for which the corrupt Joseon also proved to be profitable. In this historical KDrama it's not so much about the political intrigues around the palace, but about the landowners, administrative offices and Yangban in the provinces as well as the rebellion of the desperate rural people, who simply can't take it anymore.The struggle for democracy in Korean history, like elsewhere in the world, has been quite bloody. That was last in May 1980 in Gwangju, when the democratic aspirations of the people were brutally crushed by the military. This was so during the student independence movement in 1929 in the fight against Japanese oppression. And that happened in connection with the Donghak movement, too, which had caused quite a stir throughout the country between 1860 and 1894. ""Nokdu Flower"" is deliberately very close to the front lines of those uprisings for democratic reforms, which then had been for the first time organized on this scale. This forms the perfect background for dramatically intertwined relationship dynamics of two half-brothers, (whose father is one of the particularly exploitative provincial officials who bleed the people dry), as well as the daughter of a merchant, who is used to deal with anybody, even the Japanese, for high profit.The road to democracy on the Korean Peninsula is definitely rocky. To this day, the reactionary forces are still strong. ""Nokdu Flower"", however, represents a powerful, unforgettable symbol for the spirited struggle for freedom. The Donghak movement is often seen as the first patriotic Korean movement, since it was also about counteracting the increasing e. g. Japanese influence. But more than a patriotic struggle, initially the Donghak movement was actually about an idea that is bigger than family of origin or nation: It's about basic human rights. (An idea that, not too long before that, had also stirred up the European continent)Matter follows spirit. And this spirit was shaken up in the rural population of Joseon by a new religious movement: Choe Je-u (18241864) created a new faith in 1860: Donghak, which roughly means ""Eastern Wisdom"". Drawing from Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism and Shamanism, it sees the divine spirit at work in human beings - in ALL human beings, without distinguishing between class or gender. Additionally, it sees the world as moving in cycles - with a whole new world just waiting ahead. Nevertheless, it is blood that paves the path to a new era. Eventually, the results of the first Donghak peasant rebellion included a treaty. The ""Gabo Reform"" recognized the new religion, and among other things, the lowest classes were freed, widows were granted the right to remarry, and penalties for corruption and abuse of office were introduced. Unfortunately, there followed a second peasant rebellion...This is a story written with the blood of latest Joseon history, sort of.Overall, a highly valuable production.---------------  BY THE WAY...   ----------------------...the traditional Korean national dish BIBIMBAP is closely linked to Jeonju and to the Donghak uprising. The heart of the rebellion was in Jeolla province with Joenju being the provincial capital. Among farmers who did not have the time to prepare countless side dishes, it was common to simply mix whatever there was with rice and spices. This food proved its worth, especially when it came to feeding the rebels in their brave fight for new values and a more just future.... the TITLE TRACK is actually a popular folk song that goes straight back to the peasant uprising. ""Nokdu Flower"" actually means 'blossom of the mung beans', but here it refers to the nickname of Jeon Bong-jun, leader of the peasant rebellion.""Bird, bird, blue bird,bird, bird, blue bird,Don't sit in the mung bean fields.When the blossom fallsthe farmer goes to cry.Bird, bird, blue bird,Jeonju Gobu Nokdu bird,why don't you fly awayThe pines and bamboos are green.We thought it was summeryet it's bitterly cold and snowy.""The blue bird refers to the Japanese - they shouldnt have any business in Joseon and should go away. Joenju and Gobu are legendary places of the uprising. Nokdu refers to Jeon Bong-juns nickname and the riot. However, Nokdu, the mung bean, also refers to an important agricultural product and food. Falling blossoms indicate a bad harvest. The 'summer' stands for the first uprising, the 'cold winter' for the second. The song was probably born during the execution of the leader Jeon Bong-jun and has since become a nationwide folk song in several different versions."

And- disregarding my clever title- there is in fact a story, depicting a romance far more realistic than most portrayals in long form dramas. The interesting problem the show runners had to solve is how to split this story into eight episodes of only two minutes! The resulting miniseries is almost like slices of how you might otherwise have seen the story in a longer show.The quick and clever way they depict information within their limited time is quite impressive. We're able to pick up important exposition about the characters, their situations, and their motivations. This leaves the much-needed resulting air time to story moments that further develop the characters and add spacing to main plotline (the romance). All of this is supported by solid production and acting, and clear editing between scenes and perspectives.Unfortunately, not every mishap can be avoided with rapid storytelling, and there are a few other missteps here and there regarding creative decisions. For instance, it seems very odd and completely pointless to have a male character be the narrating voice from the perspective of our female character. Perhaps if there were internal conflicts about her sexual identity this may be justified, but as there is no such thing it just leaves us confused. Another thing they're forced to do to save time is to cut the dialogue very quickly, which does add a bit of energy but unfortunately also makes it occasionally hard to keep up or completely process the implications of the lines. In addition, sometimes it can feel like the audience is missing some kind of history between the characters, although at other times it is well implied. However, assuming these issues arose from production constraints rather than artistic direction, they can be easily forgiven.In conclusion, this miniseries delivers a surprisingly well-defined story through clever visual exposition and fast-paced dialogue, only missing a few steps here and there in production and direction on their way to an otherwise successful show. That, coupled with the extremely short runtime and consequently low time commitment, means I will firmly recommend this show."

Read till the end before getting triggered. Cons: The first half: ""Can this show get any more ridiculous?"" asked my tired brain after it finished yet another episode full of repetitive, pointless misery that was only half as entertaining than what it used to be. Don't get me wrong. The shock value is still high albeit it gets more and more predictable with every episode. The black comedy is still top notch, I was morbidly laughing my ass off 90% of the time. It's still a fairly easy to watch show. Kinda like junk food, you know it can't possibly be healthy for you but you're still watching. Almost begging for it to get better. This is a Makjang. So, I trust that if you like those and you've watched season 1 you already expect this to be over the top and exaggerated. However, despite how OTT it was, season one had a solid direction and the characters were actually built nicely. Behind all the noise, if you looked, you could find some nuance and thought behind the way characters functioned. So, by all counts it was a well made show and it wasn't a surprise that it became a household name in Korea. That's great but then obviously the drama creators got greedy and they wanted to prolong the victory for two more unnecessary seasons. By ending the last season the way they did, they found a sure shot way for us to continue. Surely, we were all angered by the triumph of the bad guys and wanted to see justice prevail. Going to watch season 2 was the easiest decision for all of us. Unfortunately, in just a few episodes, the drama writers made me effectively stop giving a shit about everyone in the show. The writing was just terrible, nonsensical and laughably bad in this one. It's like they ate a bunch of plotlines and then vomited it out on screen. There's no point of this show because things happen just for the sake of happening. During most of the drama, there isn't a single character you can root for and the evil characters that were interesting and charismatic asf in season 1 start to seem hollow and one dimensional in this. It's the same old thing over and over and over again. Bullying, murder (but not really), revenge (but not really) and Repeat. And we are getting no where. It gets tiresome to watch a repeat of season one with none of the wow factor. The worst thing is that for most of the show, the protagonist is Yeon Hee who is the single most brainless character to ever appear on tv. She was horrible in season 1 and unfortunately, worse in season 2. She functions on half a braincell and only knows how to whine and scream my ears off. That's it. Not a single ounce of sense in that woman. There are a few hilariously unfunny plot twists that the writers pulled out of their ass and they stank of bullshit. Yes, the antagonists did deliver their best. Cheon Seo Jin killed her performance as always. The acting didn't suffer and remained at the top but what's the point when you've stopped giving a fuck about the story and the characters? It's just a cycle of seeing miserable and mindlessly evil adults and teenagers be pointlessly cruel, greedy and annoying for 13 hours straight. The direction is still crisp, the drama exudes luxury of the Hera Palace and I love the brilliant music pieces but we already saw all that in season 1. For a show to function, the good guys need to be on equal footing as the bad ones but here the antagonists >>> protagonists. Even when the bad guys suffer it's mostly because of their own stupidity and infighting. Hardly any badass good guy moments in 70% of the show and at one point, you're just wishing for them all to just kill each other and save you the frustration. Pros: So, I wrote all that and you're like um, is there anything left to say? Yes, there is. The show finally picks up in the second half. Don't get me wrong, the writing is still completely bogus and the plot is very silly and unrealistic BUT you finally get a character you want to root for. This is the 30% of the show that absolutely makes you want to power through sitting right at the edge of your seat. I don't want to give spoilers but I'll just say a badass bitch is back in the house and once she comes, watching the show becomes much easier. Episode 12 is literally one of the most satisfying episodes as slowly but surely our good guys get ready to whoop some major asses. Throughout the show there are some very touching moments in the way the parent and child relationship is portrayed. Some scenes were really nicely executed and I got some major feels even when overall the drama lacks emotion because of the inconsistency in pace and writing. The ending is also very satisfying but annoying in equal measures.  Overall, is this drama WACK? Yes. Is it trying to be anything else? No.Will I be watching season 3? Fuck yes. This is the crack I run on. You don't have to use your brain while watching it and it's strangely addicting.So, keep your expectations low, turn off your brain and enjoy it to the maximum!"

It's almost comical that these rich families are figuratively cutting each other's throat so their children can be the best opera singer.  To be a great singer like Maria Callas and Kiri Te Kanawa requires real talent and the truly best diva sopranos in the world are so few that you can count them with your fingers.  Children of the wealthy are normally groomed to be the heir of their family's fortunes.  So the idea that these families, residing in one building, all obsessed with their children's singing is not only silly and ridiculous but unrealistic.The breath of fresh air in this drama was Li Ji Ah.  Her acting was perfect and she was so classy as Shim So Ryun.

It has a story and at the same time it doesn't. It's more about being a PD and the relationships and challenges that come along with it. All the while I kept thinking ""Wish I worked at KBS!""

What sets this drama apart is that everyone is likable. There are several side characters that make an impact along with the main characters. The cast had great chemistry and they seemed to gel really well. For me this drama was largely enjoyable due to the references to the current pop culture of Korea. The references to variety shows, idols and the cameos- OMG! It had me squealing out loud with laughter.

There were times this drama was a typical Kdrama. We have a love square here (like always) but for me it was a bit difficult to guess who would end up with who. Wish they had focused lesser on that and had continued the same format it had for the first 7 or so episodes. After that the drama became a bit repetitive at times.

It felt like the writer had no idea what to do with the story later on as the drama is so short. 12 episodes is way too less for me and I felt like so much more could have been explored had it been 16 or 18 episodes. It's kind of unfair, if you ask me.

Anyway, the cast is lovely and IU really surprised me with her acting. She was terrible in the beginning but she grew on me as the story progressed. Her character has the best growth out of all. Plus I loved Kim Soo Hyun in this. I normally don't like him (yeah, throw stones at me) but here he was hilarious. Gong Hyo Jin & Cha Tae Hyun were wonderful as well. But really- Kim Soo Hyun is the one who entertained me MOST here. Also the cameos like TaeTiSeo, JYP, Hani, Dara, etc. was a true treat to someone who loves kpop.

I like the OST as well and I would recommend the song 'And One' by Baek Ji Young for a listen. 

Wish there would be a Season 2 and I can probably be satisfied for real. Anyway, I am glad I watched this drama."

Masterfully made, with great actors and a much more serious tone than many of these new historical dramas that are a bit fluffier and lighter, and often feel a bit timid to go all the way with its political plot which often makes the story loses some momentum and make the tension of the story feel artificial and contrived. This drama, however, manages all of that extremely well. One can tell why it is one of the most popular historical dramas from Korea for a long time.The Red Sleeve feels serious, bold but still not too dry, so it was no fun to watch. It had a good pace to the story, and I liked the darker undertone that was always present within the narrative. Despite a more serious approach at the palace politics but still achieve a certain lightness in other aspects of the show, without those two things working too much against each other. There was a good balance between the characters arcs, the palace politics, the more romantic moments, the serious and the light.did a really good job painting this picture of loneliness within the palace and show it as this dazzling but ghostly prison for all the female characters in the show; highborn or not. Especially as we went further into the story. The loneliness of the palace does affect all the character in some way or another and becomes a big theme within the story. It has a good emphasis on how the female characters play a special role within the narrative. To me the main character, Deok Im, never wanted to be anything but free within the limits of the society she is born in, and the story always comes back to that very point. She is always true to herself while putting other before her.All her life she seems to try her best to be loyal to those who are good to her but closed off to people around her, but especially to the prince who has such great affection for her, to avoid feeling trapped by this life that she has. Because when you become his concubine, there is a certain world that is just closed to you. Its not really until shes cornered, and she sees no other way that she finally gives in to his affections. , even if she loved him, and becomes that concubine that she is destined to be. And I think it was the purpose of the story that Deok Im really had no choice but to be his wife in the end, although it was a little frustrating that he liked her more than she liked him. The romance, as much as I liked it in the beginning, lost its my grip towards the end because I felt Yi San insisted too much that he owned Deok Im, and seemed a little too domineering to me. But at the same time, I feel like it was very much part of the realism that this show seemed to convey. This is not a romantic comedy or a teenage love story. The story, all the way through, is describing the harsh reality of the palace, which was something I really appreciated (and it managed that without being too gory or grim for the sake of realism like Game of Thrones for example).It is a bit bold to present the love story of the drama in such a way and having the prince carry far more feelings for Deok Im than she seems to do for him, or it can be interpreted in that way at least, rather than showing a more of balance between their feelings. But the writing was done with such sincerity and great sensitivity, and the same can be said about the character, that I felt I understood the position of all of them, although I did not always agree with them.But even though the themes and characters of The Red Sleeve were brilliant, I found the story start to go in small circles towards the end and drag unnecessarily in certain sections as the story goes on a bit about the same thing. But I cannot blame the scriptwriters of the drama too much for that, as the drama got an extension due to their popularity and it can be hard to add new things to fill over an hour of content with something new. And it didnt hurt the story that much overall. The end result was still the same.Deok Im as well as pretty much all the female characters in the drama have my whole heart. They were all so deep, varied in characters and thought and had their own stories to tell. And too me they were the focal point of this story. And the bitter-sweet ending works wonderfully well for the story that this drama was trying to tell. Anything else would have taken from the realism of the story."

No. This KDrama has a rather gloomy side to it. Its opaque. Outrageous.You may vainly search for anything virtuous here. Let alone family values, especially when it comes to raising children. People mysteriously die. There is crime. Corruption. Affairs. Cowardice. Selfishness. There is (almost) nothing left of high moral standards. The series is heavy opera. Yet, excellently casted throughout. Everyone is doing their best. Still, whatsoever, it's not nice to look at. If the human ugliness is shown all too ruthlessly... who should one identify with? You have to delve far into your own abysses to sympathize and feel with the protagonists...

There are plenty of secrets throughout. You get Makjang, too ... obviously it can always get worse... (KDrama somehow always is great at drama!) It's opaque up to the end.

At this point I may be already biased in judging this drama objectively. I won't tell you guys to go watch this if you haven't done it yet. It's not possible for everyone to like or love it (what kind of drama can actually do that). It's also not perfect, I admit that. But despite all that I was highly entertained and mesmerized by this one and have a hard time containing my fangirling over this.

Is it truly this awesome? Yes, for me it was. It's like Healer in sageuk style. Not much similarity but the same charm that will capture your heart. The same way Ji Chang Wook convinced and bewitched me, the same way did Lee Joon Gi. Before starting their dramas I had either never heard of them before or didn't complete a drama with them yet. So, I was walking into this drama without a fangirling heart for the leads but ended up getting one.

Not much to tell about the story since the summary is already saying everything, although it's not quite accurate and a little misleading (as summaries always are, imo). But see for yourself if you start this drama.

What I liked about The Night Scholar was in fact the story-telling. The impressive and shocking beginning, the introduction of the characters, the way new events were unfolding and leading to new plot twists... and most of all it seemed like the drama always knew what I wanted to see next. The writer(s) should be complimented for giving me that kind of feeling (of a fangirl that doesn't care for logic but only wants to have her way with the characters) and still make the story work properly and logically.

As I mentioned before Lee Joon Gi was impressive and found his way into my heart. His display of the vampire Kim Sung Yeol was great. His turmoil, his growing love, his overcoming over his past love...

The other characters grew on me, too. Kim So Eun was great in portraying two different characters, esp. the conflict of her second role here. Shim Chang Min and Lee Soo Hyuk did a solid job of their roles as the Crown Prince and the evil vampire Gwi, and the supporting actors also did their parts well. Not outstanding but a solid, (most times) convincing performance.

The reason I didn't give this a 10 is simply because there were times when I wasn't fully convinced with the fights. For a mystery drama the special effects were really good. But as for some battles and confrontations... sometimes they looked a little too staged and/or forced. No matter how much I enjoyed this drama I couldn't overlook those parts as they were continuously knocking against my head. But on the other hand big compliment to the make-up artists. They did a great job with all the blood, the look of the vampires and everything else (esp. the ugly duck turning into a swan scene).

Putting that aside... Let's talk about the music. Great plus as most times in sageuks! Harmonizing with the story and making the scenes look even more emotional. I'm already in love with the OST.

Phew... looks like I still got to say all the things I wanted to tell, haha~ Hope, you enjoyed this review (although it got quite long...), despite the fact that it might sound biased.

A/The Secret House  fills the 'it's so bad it's good' hole left empty by the slow demise of the daytime soap operas in the US. I specifically mention half hour soaps because if you watched them, you're used to the pace at which ASH moves.  I'm not saying it's good or bad, but just typical.  Telenovela watchers consider yourselves warned, too.The writing could, no should have been better.  They had too many storylines going all at once . There was no way to satisfactorily handle them and tie it up in a neat little bow as we all know they do.  For me the ONLY saving grace was for the character Ham Sook Jin.  Oh did I love to hate her!  As I stated on the drama's page, I think the writer(s) had a thing for Agnes Nixon's daytime because Ham Sook Jin was like if Erica Kane and Dorinan Lord (look them up if you don't know) had a baby.  She's deliciously conniving and unapologetic.  More than half of the 8 points (4 stars) I gave the cast were for HSJ's portrayer, Lee Seung Yeon. In the hands of a less skilled actress the character could have turned into a caricature. This entire drama was carried on the back of the more ""seasoned"" professionals. The ML has gorgeous teeth and is damn attractive.  That's all the good I can say.  The FLs (I supposed that's what they were) aren't the best actresses I've ever seen. The 2nd ML was a better actor than the other leads (if you don't count Lee) and he wasn't that good.  Although, I will admit, he seemed to get better as the series progressed. There was nothing music wise that is worth mentioning.  The re-watch is zilch.  If you catch me watching this again, someone paid me. Overall, it's a typical revenge plot. Had the writers concentrated on that storyline instead of creating so many other unnecessary ones with obvious conclusions. A Secret House  would have been a much better watch."

It starts out sort of slow and quiet, and maybe a little confusing for some, at first because there are a lot of flashbacks. But something drew me in from the first episode. It may have been the sadness in the leads faces as they are trying to process their pasts and how to move forward. By episode 6 (which isn't as long as it seems, considering the episodes are only around 11-13 minutes long), they story really starts to pick up and I became more invested. Episode 9 had some weird but funny moments and ended very beautifully. The show had some stunning cinematography - very artistic, but not ""artsy"". There were also some funny visual moments as well. The ending was a bit unsatisfying, but totally understandable and realistically done. (I just wanted more because I'm greedy that way!) 

Cast - The main leads were believable and real. I thought both Ueno Juri and T.O.P. were strikingly attractive actors. If I hadn't needed to watch the subtitles I would have been totally sucked into staring at their faces. I liked Yoo In Na's side character, but she is cute in pretty much everything I've seen her in thus far. I also like the actor that played Jae Soo, but he was also eye candy. The side actors were serviceable, but could have been played by anyone really, because the two main leads just dominated the screen for me.

The only stand-out music was the song that T.O.P. sang himself. It was really pretty and just right.

However, the romance was done very well (considering I am very particular with romance), and the story was good enough, and dialogue was natural enough to make me feel immersed in this world considering the short episode lengths.

Notable A-listers such as Bae Doona and Gong Yoo will likely attract drama enthusiasts towards the dramas cast lineup and involvement. However The Silent Seas  amalgamation of different sci-fi stories  and Han Yongs attempted execution of these plot points may naturally lead to some divided opinions amongst drama enthusiasts and sci-fi aficionados alike.The plot takes place in a dystopian alternative-future where the earths water coverage  has been reduced by nearly forty -percent. In an attempt to govern humanity and ration supplies, citizens are assigned  a water grade based on a hierarchy ranking system that determines how much of the liquid theyre allowed to access. So in an attempt to resolve problems humanity attempts  to look for answers ( quite literally) in the stars.Astrobiologist Dr. Song Ji-an ( Bae Doona )is sent on a salvage mission alongside gruff soldier Han Yoon-Jae ( Gong Yoo) in order to collect samples at the deserted Balhae moon station. With both characters having their own personal motives for taking on the assigned  task the duo come across some startling and horrifying secrets as they begin their mission.Netflixs  The Silent Sea origins were admittedly still quite visionary by being  based upon Han Yongs notable short movie  The Sea of Tranquillity. Yet unlike the art-house-style influences of Yongs original directed  work,  The Silent Sea notably markets itself to a wider audience demographic as a  sci-fi and dystopian epic with  slow- burn mystery ; a mini-series  that is likely to eagerly please and disappoint in equal measure. The plot twists and turns that become  apparent throughout  The Silent Sea will likely divide those familiar with the sci-if genre; action sequences   straight out of Ridley Scotts  Alien,  a suspenseful tone familiar to Christopher Nolans  Interstellar, bilingual exchanges  paying an evident homage to Joss Whedons   Firefly( changed evidently to Korean and English ) , a  key plot point nearly strikingly familiar  to  Jo Sung Hees   Space Sweepers, and an unsurprising likeliness  to  the water -themed 2009 British series Doctor Who special  The Waters of Mars, will possibly  highlight  the fine-line between paying homage and  striking similarities to other notable works throughout the drama. Of course whilst the familiarity of some of these  plot twists does come into question when looking back at   The Silent Sea its important to point out   that the series does facilitate a solid pace with its revelations and twists right up till the last episode. However while the plot surprises  are still interesting to some extent , The Silent Sea could often neglect a crucial element to delivering its attempted tour de force moments: the cast and the characters.Bae Doona and Gong Yoo are the undeniable star- attractions of the drama through their idiosyncratic performances  offering a subtle touch of mystique and heartache as their onscreen counterparts.Nevertheless given the evident potential for character depth in a  series which explores the complexity of humanity, it will likely strike viewers as slightly unusual  that  The Silent Sea rarely diverged into using even initial exposition for  establishing character personalities and adding a tweak of depth to their seemingly profound egocentric  motives . Whilst later episodes place a quintessential limelight upon the characters roles to play in the events of the series and plot-drive, without baseline personalities ( aside from Doctor Song), notable main and important characters in the series"

There are NO skips necessary. Every episode engrosses you further into the story and there isn't one scene that is dull.  THE PLOT was very interesting to me.  Some may just dismiss this drama because of the ""good girl meets bad boy"" trope, but if you keep watching you'll see that it's not as black and white as it seems. The writing and dialogue were the two strongest points of this, hands down. This drama truly lives up to its title. As serious and melodramatic this is, there are still moments that are softening and endearing to watch, yet as fast as you smile, it will leave your face just as fast as it came. The main cast executed their scripts to a T! The portrayal of their characters really showed, and it definitely helped progress the story. THE PLOT TWISTS ARE UNPREDICTABLE and the final one left me so stunned I was literally SO SHOOK. I was so shocked as to how the story took many twists and turns in ways you never expected. THE MAIN CHARACTERS were exceptional and outstanding at the same time. The dedication that Seo In Guk, Jung So Min, and Park Sung Woong put into their characters deserves just as much if not more praise for the drama itself. The chemistry between the leads was through the roof. You really believed they were a couple who was just going through the motions. There. were barely any scenes where I didn't believe the emotions that were being conveyed, except for some scenes with Jin Kang. I felt she was too lenient with the actions of her brother and Moo Young, but then again her character was made to be very forgiving. In a way you almost pity her for being so naive and failing to face the reality of things, but that's what made her character so human. Sometimes our love for others blinds us from seeing them for who they really are. Moo young was not a good person, even to her, at times, and the audience knows this, but Jin Kang is so convinced that Moo young is good and he can do no wrong, that he is the way he is simply because life has dealt him a bad hand of cards, and that is so earnestly human. Now I'm going to talk about Moo Young. What an amazing performance. EVERY TIME HE SMILED THERE WAS NO SMILE IN HIS EYES AND THAT WAS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. you never knew if he was really being sincere with anyone, no matter how convincing he seemed. Seo In Guk delivered the best performance from a male lead in a drama I have seen thus far. I haven't seen him in anything besides this but I will for sure check out more shows with him in the future.  What a complex character. Dangerous but somehow approachable at the same time. He is cold, arrogant, selfish, manipulative, and dismissive of other people he doesn't care about(he enjoys messing with people's emotions which kinda comes off as a sociopathic), but under the surface is a severely damaged young boy who is desperate to find his identity and learn the reason behind his suffering and tumultuous past. What's sad is he grew up believing that his past defined him, and how many people out there do the same exact thing? As for Yoo Jin Gook, he played the role of Jin Kang's brother very well. He is very protective of Jin Kang, but only because she's the only family he has. As annoying as it was watching him withhold the truth, he was the perfect example of what happens when you are not honest with your loved ones. I understand that he did not reveal Moo Young and Jin Kang's past because he wanted to protect them, but had he just said the truth early on, it would have prevented a lot of the events leading up to the finale from happening(I just find it wild that he really let his sister sleep with her brother like wow). However what makes him human is the fact that he really thought he was doing Jin Kang and Moo Young justice by withholding the truth from them when in actuality it worsened the situation of everyone involved. I'm sure there was a time where we didn't tell the truth to protect someone we cared about. My only real complaint about Park Sung Woong is I felt like he could have shown off more of an emotional range. A lot times he looked too stoic and lacked the emotion that a scene demanded. Although he is flawed you understand the actions he makes and the reasons behind them. As an orphan he did the best he could to raise Jin Kang and protect her at all costs. THE MUSIC was so moving and fit the theme of emotion for every scene. Just perfect.  The melody to ""Lost"" really stuck to me and I can't stop thinking about the scenes between Moo Young and Jin Kang.Overall I give this drama a 10/10. I wouldn't rewatch cause I don't like rewatching things I've already seen even if I enjoyed it, but that doesn't mean it was anything less than amazing. The ending wasn't happy but given the tone of the drama, it wouldn't have felt right if Moo Young and Jin Kang got happily ever after. I felt a certain peace knowing that in the end, regardless of their intertwined pasts and mistakes, The two had fully accepted one another and were willing to face anything together-including death. One thing that stood out to me was that Moo Young was always self-aware of himself so he was never too far gone, and somehow Jin Kang was able to get through to him and convince him to change his ways. Had he had more time, I would like to believe that he would've become a better man. He had already started, but it was too late. It really is inevitable for a person's deeds to catch up to them. The end of their saga was beautiful and tragic at the same time, but I wouldn't end it any other way."

This drama starts off as the regular girl in utter misery meets Willy Wonka + Marry Poppins combo in a magical display of disbelief, magic and misery... The music was good, the cinematography and effects were all  amazing... And the way they adress childhood poverty may not have been revolutionary but they did manage to fit in the importance of the school meal as well as children hiding field trip expenses to not strain an already strained budget in a beautiful way. The acting and singing is really good, especially the kids. There is also an amazing parrot in this drama that will truly make you laugh and fall in love with her! As the story progresses the music subsides more or less along side the viewers faith in  the adult world and probably society as a whole... This drama and it's subjects may not be revolutionary for a K-drama but it is done beautifully and magically... There are a whole lot of great lines in this drama that may or may not restore  that faith in humanity... or rather in the next generation giving us viewers a good balance between the dark social criticism and hope for the future. This is deffinetly not a fluff piece that will make you feel all good inside but rather a drama that will make you feel more or less everything and I dare say it will also keep you on your toes (the last 3 episodes or so). Bingeabilaty: 10 Annoying side characters: nonFriendship: 10 What keeps this from getting a higher score from me is it's entertainment value, as mentioned before the first couple of episodes are well done but do not really bring anything new to the table. There is a certain awkwardness + cringe about parts of the drama and they may have overused the words: ""Do you believe in magic"" All in all defiantly worth a watch both for the musical lovers out there as well as those who do not care to much about musicals but love social criticism, important issues and drama as it does fit in quite a bit of that... "" There are no flowers on paved roads... "" p.s. The poor female lead does not have the newest smart phone..."

I personally loved the casting, I thought all the actors did a great job, but my standout performance goes to Yuri as Ae Bong, she was so funny and over the top I loved it even though at times it is a bit corny, she has her own charm. I also loved Seok's father, the actor who plays him is usually one of the villains in a political drama, so seeing him as an owner of a chicken shop and arguing with his frugal wife, was a new twist for me, but he was very funny. Another group of characters I enjoyed were the friend groups, of Ae Bong and Seok, especially Seok's friend group. When I watch scenes of all three it's just so relaxing watching 3 idiots just goof off. The show is very laid back with the occasional over the top humor, but taking it at face value as its own show, another family sitcom, not as a reboot, it is very very enjoyable, it reminds me of the 2020 series Hanging On, with a mixture of Waikiki. Each character has their own unique touch to them, there isn't really a dull moment I can think of either. I really hope you guys do give this drama a chance, and enjoy it for what it has to offer."

","Ji Soo Won, Joo Jin Mo, Kwon Yu Ri, Shim Hye Jin, Sung Hoon, Tae Hang Ho",Netflix,"Second time is a charm...  Overall: a good follow up to the first season, is funny and charming in its own way. The show gains bonus points from being a sitcom and having an episodic nature, so it doesn't feel draggy, the average length of the episode (30 mins) helps to it being more dynamic.Recommended for: anyone who wants a short show to watch, also something light and filled with comedy!StoryBefore delving into the story, I'm going to have a few words that don't necessarily focus on the show itself, mainly because I want to get this point, out of the way; and that is the fact that this show is a second adaptation from a webtoon. Couple that with the fact that the first adaptation had a popular and notable cast, the question of whether this show lives up to the first adaptation is there and in my point of view, inevitable. Season one features a couple of nods towards the first adaptation, which, on one hand is good, because it helps to shake the awkwardness around the fact that hey, there is another show; but on the other hand, it makes it unavoidable to compare the two shows. As someone who watched the first adaptation before going with this one, it made super aware of the fact that there was another show (oh, how I wished to see that cast again). But if this story has something positive about it, it's the sitcom format of both the webtoon and the show(s). And I think that's why this season was stronger than the first one, there's something that works better this season, perhaps, is the more fresh take on parenthood and family life, so it separates itself from the first season and the first adaptation. It's a show that doesn't have a deep overall plot, each episode works individually, but having the background of the first season helps to understand who the characters are and what are their relationships. ActingThe cast works well, I especially enjoyed the acting from the supporting cast, which to me is the highlight of the show. We hear many times that in ""X drama actor/actress Y carried the show on their back"", I'm going to say that while this doesn't happen on this show/season, the supporting cast brings a good background or better said ""support"" to the main cast. I'm not gonna lie, I still have some reservations towards Sung Hoon's casting as Jo Suk; in some episodes/segments he carries himself well, in others not so much, but this is a role that is the polar opposite from what we usually see him in, also this is purely a comedy series, so I give him props for embracing his character and the show. In that sense, I enjoyed Kwon Yuri as Aebong way more, her comedic timing worked well, and she brought the character to life, it was the dynamic between Aebong and Jo Suk that brought the best moments of the show.  Rewatch ValueThis show has a big rewatch value, at least for me, as it's a sitcom, you could just watch your favourite episodes when you need something funny when on a break, the story in each episode is easy to follow, so you don't need to focus only on watching the episode."

Now, they are considered a past trend and a bit cliche, especially if they are not handled with care. And, unfortunately, and although the drama had potential, it didn't ride the wave of strong episodes such as the first ones and blow off towards the ending.The beginning of the drama, first of all, was quite intriguing. The story about the half human, her sassy fiance, the vinery business and the one myth were all pretty interesting. Unfortunately, everything resolved way too easily, which robs the satisfaction of the ending. The romance was weak as well, with just a few moments in the ending to support the whole love story and a one sided puppy love for the rest of the drama. That also ruined the love triangle, as the weak main couple did not support well the antagonistic plotlines. Another major factor that made the drama look old, in addition, was the make up. White canvases with over the top red lips that screamed 'vampire' from miles were too much and made the drama look like a badly made tv movie, something that, otherwise, was not.Finally, the performances from the actors and actresses of the cast were all great and the characters quite enjoyable.So, overall, five out of ten."

I was more interested in the political part rather than the widow village scenes.6. The happy ever after at the end! ? and the Queen gets to live with the couple too!! Dont even care what happens to the King!Dislikes1. The first half was funny but then it got boring because there was not a lot of action happening and the leads just keep talking in every scene. I fast forwarded some scenes ? unfortunately.2. The King was awful and Prince Neungyang too but we know he will end up with the throne. So half of the time im asking, why waste 16 episodes just to find out the bad guy wins?

With Florida Banjeom, a popular Chinese restaurant, comfortably settled up on the roof, people from far and wide are always running in and out of the building. But it’s not the constant stream of guests that has Hae Won concerned; it’s the fact that the restaurant’s owner and head chef, Baek Eun Kyu, seems to have a serious problem with him. Having been recommended for a part-time job at the restaurant by Cha Ji Soo, a fellow restaurant owner, Hae Won thought he would easily fit in with the staff; but for some reason, Eun Kyu seems to instantly dislike him. Despite the fact that he can’t figure out why his boss is so bothered by him, Hae Won finds himself fitting in nicely with his fellow staff members, Ha Jin and Joo Seo Hyuk. It isn’t long before he’s drawing as much attention from the restaurant patrons as his equally handsome co-workers. With such a good-looking staff, there’s never a shortage of admirers at the Florida Banjeom. It comes as no surprise to Hae Won that almost everyone who visits the restaurant eventually falls for the devastatingly handsome Eun Kyu.

Even though there are some things that doesn't add up or weren't enough explained, I will forgive the story its flaws since it only had 3 hours to build up the whole thing, including the fast romance part.Everything else was fluffy and funny. The female characters might have been stereotype, exaggerated and a little too childish but some of them still grew on me. Most of all the lead and the ghost. I was especially impressed with the leads acting and I'm excited to watch more with her. She has some real potential to pull of some awesome roles. Her transformation (also the visual one) throughout the drama, from someone who looks like a witch in training from Wicked, to a fangirl that almost faints at the sight of her idol to a girl who experiences her first love, was fun to watch, even though it might not be realistic.Suho who plays the male lead... Well, he might not be the biggest actor of his generation (yet?) but he did well enough to make the story work and make me care for his love story. That he can sing is a given considering that he's EXO's leader (=frontman?). I'm wondering if he would be able to manage more difficult roles, too. So far his acting is not sticking out from the crowd.I really liked the visual aspects, colors and cinematography, and the directing style which totally added to the fluff but also to the heartbreaking scenes. They even had some unexpected side twists at the end, I wouldn't have guessed at the beginning.I totally liked the music. Not only the Korean song that were sang by the lead himself but the whole contributing part of songs that carried the mood. Instead of underlining the story with instrumental pieces or other Korean songs, they used well known English hits. I loved that. It was kinda different, and even though I usually don't like that in dramas, here it kind of gave me a nostalgic feeling due to the fact that I recognized them and my own fangirl period.Of course, quite a generous rating from me again but I don't regret watching this.

The world of spies, the unconditional obedience to orders and professional ethics as well as the swampy terrain surrounding right vs. wrong / good vs. evil is not only extremely exciting, but also multi-layered and downright critical. (With ""Moebius: The Veil"", the makers provide background information on some of the central characters of the series in an equally gripping 2-part prequel.)At the center of the ""The Veil"" is an excellent agent of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), who suddenly reappears out of nowhere one year after his mission had gone wrong. He has no memory of the past year whatsoever, but is determined to find the cause of failure at that time. The international title of the KDrama refers to the veil of the protagonist's memory that is lifted in the course of the story. At the same time, it also refers to the veils within the NIS behind which many secrets are kept hidden, and what happens when someone wants to lift them. In the original, however, the title is translated ""Black Sun"" and refers (no less symbolically) to the phenomenon of the solar eclipse.MBC spared no expense or effort in the production of ""The Veil"". With this series, the station is celebrating its 60th birthday in 2021 in a successful way that is well worth seeing. Not only excitement and action are guaranteed, but also an intelligent story that is up to date. (See side note below.) The gripping script is multi-layered with numerous characters who repeatedly move back and forth between the poles of good and evil - eventually, in this intelligence service profession it is neither clear who is who, nor is it unambiguous why...The overall first-class cast has proven itself altogether through their strong, convincing presence. Namkoong Min in particular gives everything here. He is hardly recognizable compared to e.g. ""Stove League"" from 2019. For ""The Veil"" he had trained intensively and gained 10 kilos of muscle mass. He impresses with his powerful physicality, which gives his role even more weight. In that sense, he also performed all the stunts himself.(Apropos stunts.... this KDrama has its bloody, brutal side, too... for some it could be a bit challenging at times...)Right down to the camera, light and music, everything is of the highest standard. Since both the characters and the story are so sophisticated and complex with many details, the KDrama is also suitable for re-watch - even if you know how it ends...""The Veil"" is a captivating spy thriller of international caliber that intelligently questions the philosophy, mission and ethics of the secret services from multiple angles. The story also deals with recent history and political past, with present and future NIS of South Korea.------------------ SIDE NOTE: --- political/historical context of the NIS ---The NIS has only had this title since 1999 - and not anymore since July 2020, to be precise. (The story is from 2018 though.) The history of South Korea's intelligence agency is paved with some abuse of power over its own people on South Korean soil. The South Korean intelligence service originally goes back to the KCIA (Korean Central Intelligence Agency) from 1961, which General Park Chung-hee had initiated. The responsibilities included overseeing and coordinating both international and national intelligence operations and investigations by public and military agencies. The power to get involved in political events (unsolicited and without permission) was correspondingly great. With all this, the KCIA is also one of the elite of Asian secret services in terms of the demanding training.Following the end of the military dictatorship by General Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated in 1979 by the then head of the KCIA, the KCIA was purged and operated as ANSP (National Security Planning Agency) from 1981. Their most important tasks included spying on North Korean activities and, for example, the suppression of political activists of the pro-democracy movement in their own country.In 1999 ANSP became NIS. For its part, the NIS actively intervened in domestic politics in favor of Park Gyun-hye (daughter of the former dictator) during the presidential election in 2012, prompted by the head of the intelligence service, Won Sei-hoon. In fact, that NIS campaign against Moon Jae-in resulted in him narrowly losing the election. Meanwhile, Park Gyun-hye has been in prison since 2016 on serious corruption charges, and Moon Jae-in has officially been in office since 2017 (-2022) as the 12th President of South Korea.In 2020, the government, the presidential office and the ruling Minjoo party agreed that the state secret service NIS should stay out of domestic politics in the future. In connection with corresponding reforms, the NIS was renamed ""External Security and Intelligence Service"". Illegal actions by secret service employees, abuse of power or interference in domestic politics will from now on be subject to severe penalties."

As they get closer, the ugliness of the village is revealed. ","Jang Hee Jin, Moon Geun Young, Ohn Joo Wan, Park Eun Seok, Shin Eun Kyung, Yook Sung Jae",SBS,"I'm not even sure where to start with this drama! This is my first time watching a K-Drama that is strictly a mystery/thriller, a genre I am generally a fan of (no comedy, no romance, no box of tissues necessary). I had no idea what to expect, but it definitely turned out to be a weird one. The town of Achiara is chock full of crazy, and dysfunction, which was entertaining to watch, but also completely ridiculous, and kinda confusing. It's very hard not to reveal any spoilers but highlights include family secrets, crazy town folk, sickness, perverts, murder, corruption, betrayal, messages from beyond the grave, the worst moms ever, lots of plot twists, and lots of slapping.

The story's main character, Han So Yoon, is equal parts clever hero, and gullible idiot. We learn about the town through her ""canadian"" outsider eyes, and her inability to mind her business where her sister is concerned. Moon Geun Young does a good job, but her character also often made me want to reach through the screen and shake her. The rest of the actors were fun to watch, but the acting was very over the top, and hard to take seriously at all, so I have to give the acting a 7. Shin Eun Gyeong's hysterics as Yoon Ji Sook were more funny than heartbreaking. Yook Sung Jae is super adorbs as the rookie officer. Jang Hee Jin gives a lot of great attitude faces as Kim Hye Jin. Choi Jae Woong's role was... interesting. I can go on and on for way too long about all the characters in Achiara, but my two favorites were the rebellious Seo Yoo Na, and the duplicitous Kang Jo Hee.

I also gave the story a 7, because even though I was hooked by the first episode, the crazy story line was hard to follow, and even harder to believe. In the beginning the revelations seemed redundant, but towards the end the twists just kept coming.  I will also admit that, due to cultural differences, many things that the townsfolk were scandalized by didn't seem like such a big deal, so the reactions always seemed super melodramatic. As for the ending, it does a good enough job of pulling all the chaos together, and I was not disappointed. I was still confused about a lot of things though, so that would be my only reason to re-watch any part of this drama. There are also quite a few plot holes, so maybe re-watching it won't help.

Overall, I can't recommend this drama unless you are really in the mood for a story crazy enough to make you keep watching. Not knowing what's going to happen next is it's greatest appeal, which makes it easily marathon-able. However, if you think the first episode is way too overdramatic, don't bother continuing, because the show is just getting warmed up."

It turns out to be a moving love story. Actually it is rom+/-com that starts exactly where other love stories end: with the yes word. The KDrama tells of what can happen when the butterflies (in the face of the new) are followed by ordinary years of shared, sometimes painful everyday life relationship... But that's not why love has to be gone missing. On the contrary... yet eventually, love might find it harder to take its space...The title ""The Wind Blows"" refers specifically to the moment when the two protagonists first met many years ago. At that time the wind was blowing. What started then is not over yet. Figuratively, the wind is still blowing. However, the everyday challenges of aging have now added to their married life. The two must meet those challenges. It is rather common that one may be tempted here and there to make solitary decisions instead of communicating. One may have doubts if there still can be a way together. Every now and then it seems that such a common path is not (or no longer) possible. And then, maybe, one or the other might open up again.""The Wind Blows"" tells a serious and profound story about a love relationship that has grown out of the first romantic phases. Generally, this is less wanted on screen, as it inevitabely comes with problems, arguments and breakups. (Somehow that's in the nature of relationship - the constant rubbing against each other in a wide variety of ways actually leads to feeling/sensing yourself and the other person in the first place... it doesn't work without it. Does it?) In this KDrama, problems, arguments and breakups are all in, too. But so is love. (...as so often, although we might fail to notice in the midst of turmoil.)I don't want to hide the fact that Alzheimer's disease is involved here as a stab in the back and at the same time a second chance. Against this background, the story manages to tell sensitively, empathetically and at times ruthlessly about the bumpy stretches of a patient love that has been and remains there over time - even if it is experienced differently over the course of the years, perhaps sometimes cannot be shared and also has changed its forms of expression over time.The sensitive processing and the emotionally intense acting (great: Kam Woo-sung and Kim Ha-neul) are KDrama quality at its finest, which has once again proven itself to be just perfect for dealing with such a complex subject, which is difficult in several respects.

This show was actually painful to watch.  It reminded me of a poorly written and executed high school production.  The dialogue was clunky and none of the actors seemed at ease in either what they were directed to say or do.The actors were, undeniably, attractive.  However, that doesn't mean they should be actors.  I didn't read the bios on any of the actors.  They may be new to the field; in which case I can only hope that they get some acting classes under their belts before they venture out again.Not only were their lines delivered in wooden and unnatural ways, their movements reflected the same problems.  You could actually see the blocking of the scenes, there wasn't a natural flow.  For example, one person walks across the room to sit down, the other actor stands woodenly until the actor has finished walking and sits down, then the second actor starts walking across the room as well.This will definitely be going on my ""That's time I'll never get back"" list."

If you're like me, you're probably wondering what the title ""The Witch's Eye"" means.Yes, there is a character who could be considered a witch, she is the proprietor of a tarot shop where she reads her customers to filth (as the cards often do), and she occasionally demonstrates her powers when posed against supernatural threats. And sure, there are some cool glowing eye special effects here and there, but what does HER eye specifically have to do with the plot?But then you start to notice some recurring details.Da Bit is an influencer who starts her day advertising colored contacts.Supernatural characters' eyes glow when something significant is about to happen.Several characters wear glasses and we even get a look at Do Hee's gorgeous collection of frames.And the breadcrumbs start to fall into place just in time for Davich Optical Chain to rise up from the shadows like the final boss and slap you with the ""IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!"" dramatic reveal.The writer(s) tried so hard to incorporate it organically into the plot, but poor Sung Jun's out here sounding like a PSA for eye exams all of a sudden. I thought he was about to drop another tragic backstory on us when he hits us with a pitch for why optometry is an important career path instead. Joke's on you, Davich Optical, I was squinting at my laptop screen for the entire 1hr17min runtime instead of wearing my glasses like I was supposed to!Overall, the plot is compelling and the mystery it introduces was built up rather well so that it makes sense seeing the pieces gradually come together. While the female leads have far more mutual chemistry than the relationship with the love interest, this story is sadly not a queer one... even though other characters almost seem to acknowledge that it could have been.So, if you're interested in series that explore karma, past lives, and meddling deities - and you don't mind being shamelessly advertised to when the story comes to an awkward temporary halt about halfway through - this one may suit you pretty well. In spite of every other nitpick, my one true complaint is that there was not enough tarot in that tarot shop. The tiny glimpse we got of the cards looked so good! I need more!"

I kinda started to lose interest by ep12 ish, and I think that's when they tried too hard to add more conflict so the story doesn't end, but they didn't want a rushed ending so they made ep15 seem like a pre conclusion, but then they kept adding conflict after the resolution becasue they had 2 more hours to go.like the ""I'm sorry"", ""I'll kill you"", ""let's forget this"", ""I'll kill you"" dance...for one thing,  I'm glad of how they handled Ye Rim and Je Hyuk, but just like the rest of the story I feel like they gave us too much buildup/middle ground and not enough cleanup/closure?like they never talked about Hyun Seo or In Gyu again. so what? was it suicide? was it not? why did they play us to think it might be Yoon Gi?and the son running away? then they didn't show his face at the end? why because he looked older or they couldn't film that scene with the real actor? becasue it was a last minute thought?when Tae Oh tried to kill himself I got the desperation, but it was a slow street, even if the bus/truck hit him he'd have only broke a bone or two. it was not going that fast, but I was emotional when they revealed that he wasn't dead. otherwise I'd have given it a 1 ;)also all of those scenes making it seem like they were going to kill the son? come on that was a cheap move..which makes me wonder if the son running away was the writers ""punishment"" for Sun Woo, because at the end of the day she was not blameless in that messbut I do admire them for breaking away from the revenge mold, usually it takes them 10eps to uncover the secret and 5eps of omg I can't believe, with 1 wrap up party..the ost was great and I never rewatch stuff"

I really couldn't. The trailer and synopsis hooked me in and I went in knowing it was based on a non-fiction book but what I really did not expect was how slow it was. It was advertised as a thriller but its most definitely not. Instead, it's an extremely slow burn with no end in sight.  The story is told in almost like a documentary-like fashion. The main character (Kim Nam Gil) is portrayed as eccentric, aloof yet empathetic and ""special"" in a way only main characters are.  This ""special"" quality is what landed him the newly created role of a profiler.  Predictably, no one appreciates the profilers from the start and look down on them, scorn them, and they are allocated the worst office in the building. Of course, the profilers are full of tenacity and overcome these various challenges to finally attain the recognition they deserve. It's a tale as old as time, and anyone can see through the plot of this show right from the first episode. Nothing groundbreaking at all, and nothing to keep viewers watching through the end. In addition, the culprit for each case is revealed right off the bat so there is even less payoff to watch and try to figure out who the murderer is.  What we do get are long drawn out interview sessions with serial killers showing off how crazy they are. After a while it just got ... boring. I'm not sure why either. I've watched the Criminal series on Netflix where it's set 100% in the interrogation room yet it was a million times more exciting that this show. Which is disappointing. The characters also don't experience any growth at all; the profilers still treat each other like strangers despite working together for YEARS. Main character retains his ""specialness"" all the way and his only fault is being too empathetic. Meh. Oh, and there was also this strange subplot about this reporter girl which added 0 things to the plot and only served to show how ""special"" and ""empathetic"" that reporter girl is. I thought the show wanted to force a romance between her and the main character but seeing as how nothing happened even at the 11th episode, I guess not. The acting is fairly good, if you don't mind watching people behave like they're in a constant state of depression (which I guess is true considering the heavy stuff they deal with constantly). The show is the epitome of the saying ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" because literally all characters are raging workaholics who do not seem to have hobbies outside of work. Which makes it hard to see the range these actors can show.Conclusion: watch only if you can stomach extremely slow paced dramas with no payoff at all. This is not a thriller - though there are some ""thrilling"" fight scenes. If you prefer more traditional police procedural shows, this is not the one for you. I honestly feel that juvenile justice, a show supposed to be about judges, has more thrilling police investigation scenes than this show LOL, so make of this what you will."

Aware of the American F.B.I. and its successful use of criminal profilers to identify serial killers, the head of the Criminal Behavioral Analysis team, Gook Young Soo recruits Song Ha Young, a quiet, reserved, incredibly perceptive former detective for his team. Gook believes using this new psychological method will give the police an edge in capturing 'Red Cap' and ending his killing spree.
Homicide expert Yoon Tae Goo and her officers question the value of this approach and are resistant to entering such uncharted territory. To quell their scorn they need to convince that this radical crime-fighting approach will increase their arrest rates. Does Song Ha Young have the ability to gain the trust of callous criminals while seeing through them? Is he clever enough to outwit them? But more importantly, does he possess the emotional fortitude to withstand the process?","Jin Seon Kyu, Kim Nam Gil, Kim So Jin",,

The story really surprised me, in a very good way, there is comedy, unrequited love and competitions about their work. The show focuses on an entertainment company that accepted a new group of interns. In the office each one of them is assigned to a senior that will guide them. Their goal is to make channels and stuff famous, get more likes and views. Because of that they compete quite a lot since each of the seniors (with their intern) works with a channel. The relationships between the employees there are very fun to watch, the comedy is great and their job is surprisingly exciting. (I haven't written many reviews so please be nice hahahah.

However, the ending was way too cliche for korean drama standards. Still, the main couple had chemistry and many cute moments. I actually don't love student-teacher romances, but this one was well created and explained, so it was easy to overlook. The sport theme wasn't overlooked, which was a plus for the drama as well.

He also steals the thunder from the main lead, who is pretty cookie-cutter good guy material. The girl is cute at first, but gets way too annoying towards the ending, especially when she kind of double dates both guys. Also, for a 'geeky' girl, she was too toned down. We only get to see her study alond with the male lead for like two episodes. And her wearing glasses does not make her a 'geek'. Other than that, the drama focused more on the romance than the sports, which was disappointing, but they did add some scenes towards the end with a game of two.

Then watch this drama. Do you feel like there's no hope for humanity? Then watch this drama. Maybe that's a bit harsh, but that's how I felt watching ""Time"",  a drama that pretends to be a romance but is actually a series of non-stop frustrating sads. If you are looking for something extremely ""Emo"" to add to your watchlist, you've found it! Normally I am a fan of melodrama, but the unrelenting bad mood feeling this drama gave me seemed unnecessarily bleak. I only kept watching because the beginning seemed kinda promising. Initially, I expected a beautifully tragic romance, but I got a disheartening revenge plot instead.This drama revolved around the quintessential jerk of a chaebol Cheon Soo Ho, played by Kim Jung Hyun, and the optimistic but always struggling Seol Ji Hyun played by Seo Hyun. I thought Kim Jung Hyun was great and initially liked Seo Hyun, but eventually, their chemistry got traded in for a convoluted revenge story that I just didn't like. I felt like the story wasted the development of a great character, Cheon Soo Ho, and instead focused on turning Seol Ji Hyun into an unconvincing mastermind who kept giving everyone the side eye so much that I forgot I initially liked her character. Maybe a better actress could have pulled off Seol Ji Hyun's transformation but as the star of this story she was pretty boring, and unimpressive.The side characters were fine. Hwang Seung Eon and her super purse and Kim Joon Han as the worst ex ever were really good, with a relationship that became even more interesting than the main couple, but because of the overload of melodrama, many of the characters became too two dimensional. By the end, I had no real interest in any of them.I suspect that the last few episodes were not what was originally intended because they seemed so thrown together and tried to overcompensate with the drama. Soo Ho made me sympathize and even boo hoo cry the more I learned about him, but once Soo Ho was no longer the focus I lost any lingering interest in this show. I just finished it to see how it would finally end, and to see if the ending would justify the depressing tone. Maybe some people found the end inspiring, but I did not. I felt like all the suspense lead to a pretty boring conclusion. There were a few themes about classism and trust that could have been interesting, but the story was just too clich for me to invest any real feelings into it. Overall if evil CEOs, terminal illness, rich people behaving badly, betrayal & revenge sound like the makings of a great drama, I'd say there are other dramas that do those things much better than this. But if you feel like brooding over how unfair the world is then maybe this is the perfect drama for you. As for me, I'd recommend just waiting for whatever drama Kim Jung Hyun has coming up next."

However, there is about a two-minute recap at the beginning of each episode and 2-3 minutes of credits at the end of each episode, so these episodes are REALLY short.  Unfortunately, this leads to not enough content in this drama.I was grabbed by the idea.  The concept of him remembering everything, and her remembering nothing was a very interesting one to me.  But there really wasn't enough time to adequately flesh this out.  We saw him living out a tragedy in his past, and we saw repeatedly how he remembered everyone's name, but there was a BIG link to the story that he didn't remember until almost the last episode, so how can you say he remembers everything.  She doesn't mention until a few episodes in that she only remembers things for a month and then her memories resetI would have liked to have seen how she deals with having to reset her memories every month, and how her friends deal with it.  That would have been fascinating.  This wasn't addressed at all.The ending is very abrupt.

The story itself was rather simple, but fun to follow. Fish out of water scenario makes it easy to create some comedic elements, and Jun more than delivers in the role of Eun Ho with his facial expressions and natural line delivery, making the show worth the watch. Seeing how the drama has a fantasy element and the whole background of it to explain, they truly wasted a lot of time on Lee Heon and his storyline. Who is there to kill him and why - truly unnecessary. Him being the abandoned Crown Prince that needs to hide to save his life is enough information. Then, there is also the issue of Eun Ho just gives up on trying to find out why he traveled to a painting and finding a way out. Good few episodes he has been just chillin with the prince and his glam bodyguard, without making any effort to figure out what was going on. A few too many times I said to myself What is going on? for me to conclude the story was well paced and presented. Not gonna lie, I did finish the show purely for Jun and his portrayal of Eun Ho. He was great with his funny, but realistic reactions and it was worth spending these 12 minutes a week on the rest of this rather mediocre project. Yoo Hyun Woo was fine during the soft and calm scenes, sadly, his delivery in more emotional ones failed to evoke any emotions in me. Kim Tae Jung was just there. With the way Go Geum was written, I dont think he had that much work to do. Overall, I believe this show would flow better as a movie. Watching it two episodes per week was a mistake.

Simple plot that is connected to all the characters, great acting, amazing chemistry, bop of a soundtrack and aesthetics shots.To My Star is proof that you do not need complex, over the top, dramatic, and ridiculous sub-plots to make a good show. It's obvious the writer and director had a clear vision of what they wanted to show, and they focused on making it as high of a quality as possible. And they succeeded! All the subplots connect and affect all the characters, so you don't feel like watching different shows depending on who is the focus of certain scenes. Things hinted at the beginning are addressed by the end, and no loose ends are left.Characters wise - pure perfection. There was not one character that felt redundant. They all were fun, unique and felt like real people. The chemistry between the leads was amazing, but it's worth talking about the awesome synergy between the supporting cast. Not one scene felt boring, and I truly enjoyed every second of the show.From the opening scene I knew, To My Star will be a feast for my eyes, and I was not wrong. The show was just beautiful. Lately I am tired of the ""shaky camera"" and cuts and changes of frames and angles every few seconds. The still shots were a blessing. I could truly appreciate the scenes and what was happening in the story when I was not being distracted by random cuts.The soundtrack. I mean - I need to google all the songs. I never care for the OST. As long as it's not distracting, I rarely even remember or care for even one song. Here though I am truly speechless at how good it was.With all the love I give and all the praises, why not 10? We all have our own pet peeves, sadly this one hit some of mine... One being ""crying without tears"" and the other: random, poorly delivered English lines (acting wise, not language wise - clarifying so no one will get pressed again). But these are minor problems that most people will not even notice.Overall, definitely one of my favorite BLs. Definitely one of my favorite rom-coms overall. I just love the simple and chill vibe it had, the wholesome feels and the great production value taking into consideration how small of a project it was compared to mainstream dramas. The acting was just gold, the chemistry made me feel lonely and in need of a relationship, the OST made me want to dance, and the aesthetic scenes made me take too many screenshots.Make yourself happy - watch To My Star."

I guess somewhere between explaining what happened to the FL and how much she has suffered from her ex, the magic was lost.For an office drama, Today Office Tomorrow Romance took the perspective of dating in the office. And where other dramas show the viewer the pros and cons of an office love story, this one opted on romanticizing everything and throwing all the blame on the bad personality of the ex character. Most of the drama goes by while we see the main character struggling to get over what happened to her and the rest of them justifying her behavior on that event. On a positive note, however, the business case they took upon was okay and entertaining for a while. Still, the main love story was rushed, too sudden, and almost cheesy.Finally, for the performances, everyone did great, though the FL was a bit awkward in the beginning. But, she was fine after that shaky start.So, overall, 3 out of 10."

(重版出来!) by Matsuda Naoko (松田奈緒子).","Choi Daniel, Jang Sung Yoon, Kim Gab Soo, Kim Se Jeong, Ko Chang Seok, Nam Yoon Su",SBS Viki ViuTV,"Great moments rather than a great story.  This could have been a perfect warm, cheerful, positive and destressing show with some fun and quality characters and great messages and dialogues, if it only had a solid direction of the plot. But it turned out to be a bit of a mess, with few gems here and there and a lot of unresolved frustration for me. At first, they set the stage perfectly. We know who the main characters are and what their goals are. Who they need to fight against and what are the stakes. And then it all gets sidetracked and everything loses focus as we get more and more not well established side conflicts that are resolved in a half-assed manner. Instead of truly diving deep into these underdogs trying to survive and strive in the company, keeping their webtoon team on board, we got a lot of random side stories and problems that were loosely related to the overall plot. Honestly, its the first time when the villain did not have to do anything, because the issues kept showing up even without his involvement. Things started moving forward in that aspect only in the last few episodes. Quite a weird and not engaging plot progression, if you ask me. Overall, there were just too many side plots and characters, so nothing felt truly developed and all conclusions anticlimactic. The good point in how some messages were delivered was the fact the viewers get the ""lecturing"" and life lessons WITH the main character, and not delivered BY main character. Thanks to that, it never came across as preachy.Onto the characters, On Ma Eum was amazing, until she wasnt. Extremely optimistic and hardworking. What's important - she did not think things would just go well, she believed she could work hard to make them go well. She bet on her work, not luck. While she is a bit stuck in her ""positive"" world and attitude and fails to instinctually see how other people might have different approaches, once confronted, she tries to understand other people and act according to the new information.Where her character failed was any and all interactions with Shin Dae Ryuk. Calling her approach as ignorant would be a compliment to how it truly went. On the surface it was all cute, nice and uplifting, but by the end, I just wanted this girl away from this child. Seok Ji Hyung and Jang Man Cheol were amazing seniors and great mentors. I appreciated how I got no romantic vibes from Ji Hyung and Ma Eum. I loved to see their mentor-mentee dynamics. They tried to stir the pot with previews, but I learned not to trust them early on. I think we as viewers are conditioned to see romance everywhere, so even deep, platonic relationships seem to hint at romance for us. Goo Jun Yeong might have seemed like this asshole cold main lead, but he was actually quite cute and harmless. He was straightforward with what he said, reacted well to people guiding him and took suggestions and advice to heart. He was far more open to new things than I thought he would be. Its true that he had his ups and downs, but thats what made him an interesting character. All that said, with the great cast of the main characters, the one that truly stole my heart was Shin Dae Ryuk. Its literally a crime how such an interesting character with such a complex background was not more of a prominent figure in the show. That wasted potential just makes me sad, and the conclusion to his story - mad. I dont say it a lot when thinking about dramas, but this was truly offensive. It was so bad, I cannot even simply dismiss it as an ignorant take. I don't have that much to say about the acting - everyone did a great job. Kim Se Jeong's existence is just unfair to us all. Not only is her singing just phenomenal, but she is also an amazing actress. She is so natural, no matter what role she takes. Also, the scene stealer, show stealer and hearts stealer - Im Chul Soo. Production wise - typical kdrama. It was not breathtakingly beautiful, but it had some great moments screenshot worthy. Cant remember one song, so that sums up the OST quiet well.Overall, it was a nice watch. You know how there are some books with amazing quotes, but when you have to talk about the plot, you have barely anything to say? This drama is similar."

By providing an emotional link between the two worlds through the protagonist Choi Joon-woong, the worlds inspire each other with their insights and impulses. (After all, a wound can even heal in the afterlife...)In short, the approach might at times seem light-footedly playful. Yet the content is profound and serious. Its no feel-good-series.

Overall the narrative style once again finds the right tone and the successful mix to work through the difficult, complex emotional area of conflict.

As others have said, it's more of a ""slow burner"". I liked the feel of the show at the beginning - the cinematography was perfect and the show had this dreamy quality to it. So I stuck with it even when some parts were confusing for me. The middle parts got a little bogged down, but I felt like it ended well with most questions answered satisfactorily. 

I thought that Shin Min Ah and Lee Je Hoon had a great chemistry together and the romance was delicious to watch. But the rest of the acting for them wasn't as good as it could have been. I've seen them both do a better job, but I don't know if the direction and script played a part in how they were lacking here. 

I enjoyed the story enough. But around episode 10, I was really just ready to see the ending. I did feel like they ended the show well, and wrapped up the storyline in a good way. I was worried about it around episodes 12-14. But the writers pulled through and connected the ending with the crumbs they laid out on the way. I have to give them credit for that. 

The music was nice and went with the feel of the show.

I won't re-watch this, but I don't feel like it was a waste of my time. This show was decent and the romantic parts were better than the rest of the story. It was enjoyable enough, but probably won't be memorable."

I don't know if his martial arts skills aren't as strong as the others but the one time he did fight he laid out the leader which was hilarious and bad to the bone  altogether. The one time he did get hit was by his middle school's best friend. That guy was a total douche. His pride was so in the way that he literally got beat in every scene he fought. He did have some mad fighting skills but it went for nought a lot. Even his posse could fight better and none of them got beat after they were beat by the main two male characters.Some of the 'bad guys' looked a little too old to be in high school too. As one commenter mentioned females showing up and doing a stare down, I just knew they were going to have some fight scenes but no. It cut away to something else,I whooped and clapped when I saw Ma Dong Seok doing his infamous slapping in one of the episodes. He's grown on me since Bad Guys.I was upset about the ending. Korea loves to toy with martial arts fans by making episodes seem like they're going to continue only to not have any more shows.Forgive the low rating for rewatch values.

Im sure such a thing would be even more rewarding to binge-watchers.Also in terms of production quality, Train didnt fail expectations!! That chilling dark vibe OCN always sends is clearly there. Cinematography is neat and somehow depressing, with a warm yellow tone for world A and a blue cold one for world B (each similar to their perspective characters!). Editors really did a brilliant job seamlessly switching from world A to B to the past to flashbacks. Music was also on point. Lyrics Im gonna find you, playing at the end of each episode, make you look forward to the coming one, and another soft melody singing I want to stay with you makes emotional scenes a bit more felt.On the other hand, Train is quite predictable, which is not necessarily a bad thing as I was still eager to watch and see if my theory was right or wrong, and everything was built up well with no apparent holes. But I found it cheap that certain characters had suspicion written all over their faces!! I have to admit, it made the resolution a bit underwhelming.  I wished if writers would bring another twist but everything was foreseen at the end.Another thing that bothered me was how I failed to connect with characters and their emotional scars. Although it could be only me, I think they could have chosen a better cast tbh. Most of the time, It felt like YSY was carrying the whole show on his shoulders. He totally lived his character and showed diverse emotions either playing the workaholic detective who lives to care&protect or the discontented inspector who lives with hate&shame. I rooted for him but it felt hella frustrating that no one was responding!The FL was rather weak (in terms of performance); she had that one angry/sad expression on her face that I was absolutely numb towards. Im not trying to undermine the actresss effort, but in my eyes, they had little to no chemistry and it always felt one-sided. That shouldnt be much of a problem for a thriller really but Itd have been much better if the story was more seasoned and I could feel the desperation to save someone or catch someone, yet clearly the mystery element was my only driver. Thats in part a problem with writing too; cause most characters lacked personality and development, the main culprits character is so cliche, and many were merely running the story, I could see no problem if one of them was replaced :( If theres anyone I loved, itd be Jung min (the forensic doctor)& Jinwoo (junior detective).Regardless, Train was an experience I enjoyed and anticipated every week. I recommend it and Im pretty sure many will like it :)"

In my opinion if this was 16 episodes, like some previous series like The guest and Save me, it would probably become a little  boring halfway through and then it would be great again in the last few episodes.Secondly, this was a series that I was (im)patiently waiting for every week. I loved the story from the beginning with that dark vibe that OCN knows how to handle. I liked all the twists that the show had to offer and the acting was good (in my opinion at least). Finally, the whole psychopathy thing made me shiver as I though all of the characters previous scenes, including his intense feeling about sadness and sorrow and the will to avenge for everything that he lost. Even though this is not the first time that that kind of twist has appeared -and it will probably not be the last- the cruelty from the character and the understanding from the viewer that no matter what happened he didn't feel anything, was enough to make this show a great watch. I liked all the characters in this series and I would probably watch it again as it is, as I mentioned before, a seven episode drama.The only complain that I have is the ending. I suppose that OCN is preparing for a new season, but I believe that if they had finished the series properly and without plans of making another season this would be even better."

Well, secrets, lies, denial and the  ever same muddy downpath of politics.We get to see a rather shy female lead character who is married to an obviously really nice and considerate husband. He started in  politics and for her personal reasons the fl asks her husband for him to keep her out of it and the limelight. He believably promises to do so.The rather idyllic family picture gets first scratches when their student son is suddenly found dead. We just get clues what could have happened to him but can't be sure. Then, out of nowhere for the couple, the gilrfriend of the son shows up at their doorstep claiming to be pregnant from the deceased. Unwillingly they take her in, also to prevent any image damaging scandal to get out. Rather slowly, step by further step we find out about the fl's past and what is haunting her, and understandably why she is shy and wants to stay out of the limelight.Around episode six I was fully sold to the ml being a nice and caring husband and even felt angry towards the fl for not just talking to him and telling him her problem. At that point I couldn't understand why she would not confide in this caring husband of hers. I fully fell for his ways and believed him.But slowly things start to feel uncertain concerning the ml. Is he really that caring and trustworthy husband? Until epsidode12 I started to feel torn, just like the fl, I was sure he was dishonsest,  (and in many  ways, especailly _EXcluding_ being unfaithful to her!)  I got angry with him and when she confronts him once and again he is so convincingly sad, sounds so truthful and gives such heartfelt explanations that I doubted the feeling of mistrust again Oo Only in the last four episodes things become clear about the motives and background ties several people have, and it was a first in a long time that I sat in front of the screen being so surprised about the story twists and revelations that come up I even said 'no way! No he did not!' out loud. Like most I am used to knowing rather fast into a drama who did what, who lies, who betrayed whom. But here I felt so unsure and I was genuinly suprised what happened in the late episodes of this drama, especially concerning the ml who succeeded in luring me in and making be doubt my momentary impression again and again. I just wanted to believe him. The whole story is also about how rather often women and girls experience vioelence, especially sexual violence and assault, and the rather sad fact that still in many countries the victims are made the guilty ones by society and even police and courts. The name of the drama 'trolley' is explained quite in the beginning, and in the end makes perfect sense, showing you can only do one good for the cost of another, but never save everyone without losing someone else.It's a bitter ending with lots of pain, and hurt feelings and some sparks of hope at least.I highly recommend this if you like dramas that are not obvious and where you won't get everything spoonfed with a verbal explanation. If you are patient enough this drama gets very tense and at least I was not able to pause watching the last 5 episodes, I just had to know what happens next. I also was (once again, but I might be biased ;) impressed by Park Hee-soon. I first saw him in a movie called 'the scent'  many years ago, where, in a completely different setting and mood, he had that ability that although he betrays and does questionable things, I am willing to forgive his character. Same, in a starkly different setting again in 'my name' where in his role as Choi Mu-jin I defintely know he is dangerous and brutal, he still drew me in and I felt sorry for him. This was now the third time, here in a setting as believably caring and loving husband where I just wanted to believe him and  even in the very end, after knowing what he did, still felt sorry for him and kind of liked him. Seems like he as a special psychological thing going and working on me to fall for this and throw my rightly warning ratio overboard."
True Beauty,8.3,"Comedy, Drama, Romance, Youth",#195,2020.0,2020.0,16,75.0,162611.0,"Adapted From A Webtoon, Beauty, Beauty Standards, Hidden Identity, High School, Makeover, Nice Female Lead, Popular Male Lead, Secret Crush, Smart Male Lead, Transformation","True Beauty is a romantic comedy about a high school girl Lim Ju Gyeong, who rises to pretty girl fame after she masters the art of make-up from YouTube. She turns into a goddess because of her makeup skills, but would rather die than reveal her bare face to anyone. It tells her love story with the only boy that saw her without makeup, Lee Su Ho. Lee is an attractive and handsome boy who appears cold because of his dark past but is actually very caring. They grow when they meet each other sharing their secrets and finding love with each other, but can Su Ho make Ju Gyeong find her true beauty?","Cha Eun Woo, Hwang In Youp, Jang Hye Jin, Moon Ga Young, Mun Ka Young, Park Ho San, Park Yoo Na, Park You Na",tvN,"True Beauty;  A Love And Hate Relationship  Lets be honest. The original webtoon of  True Beauty has always had either a  love and hate relationship even amongst fans; the main heroine  has little character growth, her relationships and decisions are  questionable ,and the storyline hits a major snag after the halfway point as well.Respectfully  we should always try to take a step-back when watched a drama adapted from an original webtoon, novel or a reboot  as a standalone production; writers often make very  different decisions ( whether for better or worse) than the original creator with either  storyline, themes  or characters, and it is  certain to say that  writer Lee Shi Eun , did make some necessary and unnecessary changes in TVNs latest eponymous drama  adaption of the webtoon. The biggest change to note is the predominant setting of the drama  on our female lead Lim Ju Kyung ( Moon Ga Young) in   high school for a major proportion of the series. Whilst naturally this did see the series brush over  some notably darker issues of bullying, abuse and academic pressure, this also gave  writer Shi Eun more playing ground with the joys and  delights of intrinsic  teen angst and overused teen drama cliches. From the evident love interests of Suho ( Cha Eun Woo) and Han Seo Jun ( Hwang In Yeop) for our female lead, to other issues of bullying and love rivals on top, Shi Eun pulls at all the stops to make True Beauty, an overly cliche and  sugarsweet romance drama with more and more ridiculous tropes and scenarios as the episodes progress. Nonetheless it is wrong to write off that the show didnt do anything well either, in particular towards our actors. Whilst Ga Young did have a couple of questionable acting  moments, for a major proportion of the series, she perfectly captured  the awkwardness, humour and more angst-ridden moments of our female lead. Similarly whilst  Eun Woo is certainly a fairly veteran  actor within romances , some of his past  leading man  performances have come off as a little  wooden and lacklustre . It wouldnt be lying to say that his role as Suho doesnt not stand out as much as some of his previous works , however, it is prominent that Eun Woo  did add a level of genuine heart and comedy to his role as Suho as well. Notably rising star Hwang In Yeop s performance as Seo Jun has caught a lot of attention by viewers and fans with a surprising level of awkwardness, emotion and angst behind Seo Jun as a fleshed-out character, something which certainly must be given praise for as well.This of course does move on to the shows tackling  of characterisation throughout the series, with some notably mixed results by the ending . The biggest elephant in the room must be addressed through the character of Kang Soo Jin ( Park Yoo Na). Similar to her  original webtoon character, Soo Jin is sighted as a  natural beauty who lives in an abusive household and has a complicated relationship with Su Ho, however, the most notable change from the webtoon occurs within her 180- degree  personality change in the beginning  from a conniving social media influencer in the webtoon , to a studious and angelic friend for Ji Kyung during the drama. Honestly, Soo Juns character introduction  had a lot of potential in comparison to her webtoon counterpart , with a seemingly strong of morality and strength by notably helping Ji Kyung out from an awkward situation during their  journey  to school on the bus before even getting to know her.  As most romantic cliches have proven, however, female animosity is the adored cliche of screenwriters, and it soon provides a downwards slope for Soo Jin as both a character and an individual as well. It is important to advocate that it is not necessarily Soo Jins feelings towards Soo Ho which make her suddenly a  terrible person over the course of the series, but rather how screenwriter Shi Eun unevenly mismatched Soo Jins later actions and decisions ( especially towards Ji-Kyung) near the finale.Whilst Shi Eun attempted to amend this in the final episodes, the damage had already been done quite irrevocably, possibly making Kang Soo Jin, the epitome of writing a terrible second female lead.On a more positive note, however, the most prominent praise for characterisation must be given to Ju Kyungs development as our heroine ( especially in comparison to the webtoon). Although it was a little painful that Ju Kyung did not talk out about her more dire decision in episode 1 to her family and still retained oblivious naivety at times ( stereotypically to Soo Jins feelings) , she did gradually  begin to learn to grow more self-confidence and respect for herself as an individual ; something which is an important stage for any healthy relationship. Equally Suho upon first glance, was intrinsically cliche and effectively a  Mary- sue of the drama and webtoon world ; overly good-looking  , stylish and intelligent, however, alongside Seo Jun, Suho had some  notable character growth as a character passed off  as impassive and aloof,  to  being a notably  non-judgemental individual towards physical appearances, but rather assessing someone based upon their  individual personalities and actions   . ( Perhaps the one aspect which would have intrinsically explained this more to watchers, would have been to have the included the key aspect of Suhos background as a  half Japanese-Korean , resulting in him often being bullied from a young age and determining physical appearance as meaningless ; something clearly left out of the show in order to avoid controversy by Shi Eun.)  From opening up about some aspects of his difficult past and childhood,  his buddying friendship to blossoming feelings for Ju Kyung as well as refreshingly partially- reconciling with Seo Jun, did allow Suho to have some decent characterisation(despite the array of cliches that the show threw in our way) . So, this leaves us on the big question; is it actually worth watching? True Beauty will always have a love-hate relationship with drama and webtoon  fans - the storyline is sugary sweet ( with little sense of realism or grittiness despite the  angst apparent in the storyline), the tropes overtake actual story investment and some of the characters are fairly abandoned by the ending of the drama. Nevertheless there are some good things to note about the show; the OST is fairly catchy, the cast help to  flesh- out all of our characters and the majority of our main protagonists have some deeper character development over the course of the series. Therefore it is fair to say that it really depends what you are seeking from this show; a cute,  fluffy and unoriginal teen drama which you can binge watch? Then, definitely. Something to actually invest time into an original portrayal of the difficulties of romantic relationships as students? Then, probably not as there are certainly better dramas out there to consider."

This was the case here as well, even though the beginning presented the main lead as the victim. However, what the drama did need was time. Time to explore the characters more, time to expand the story more and give a more in depth perspective of the side characters, as well as a better explanation of the events. Moreover, a smoother pace at the conclusion would have been ideal, as it was rushed and too easily resolved. But, where things were left was a nice touch. The performances, finally, were pretty good from everyone in the cast. The flash backs were masterfully handled too.So, overall, five out of ten."

Although the element of time travel caused controversy after its release, OCNs  Tunnel should not be mistaken as a  cheap imitation or a  copycat of  tvNs successful production Signal. In fact, apart from the tenuous links between both shows being  loosely based on  the real-life South Gyeonggi serial killer case( and of course the element of time travel fantasy) ,the storylines are derisively different.   Tunnel focuses upon a  1980s detective called Park Gwang Ho ( played by Choi Jin Hyuk). Desperately  trying to catch a serial killer murdering women in hope of protecting his wife , he chases the killer through a tunnel, and when he comes out the other side he finds hes been transported 30 years into the future and is in 2017. As the  killer hes been chasing resumes his killing spree in this future time zone,  Gwang Ho assumes   the identity of a young policeman and works with new colleagues, including his efficient partner detective Kim Sun Jae (played by Yoon Hyun Min) and their icy criminal psychology consultant Shin Jae Yi (played by Lee Yoo Young), who will hopefully help him to catch the killer. Perhaps the greatest thing to note about  Tunnel is through its ability to develop characters without airbrushing over their intrinsic flaws over the course of the series. Although Choi Jin Hyuk is a brilliant actor, his character Gwang Ho undeniably appeared as a little off-putting for viewers to truly warm-up to at first. Gwang-Ho  is austere, abrupt and sardonic ; very much a product of his time. Often, he  often locks horns with the younger and tech- savvy detective Jae Yi over his old-school methods. Ultimately, however, Gwang Ho has a kind-heart and strong moral drive- a man of duty who is desperate to get back to his wife. Perhaps the one thing which often struck me as a little odd about Gwang Ho as a character can be found within his interactions with the modern world. He does undeniably struggle with the sudden changes thrown in front of him, yet certain reactions towards technology often seemed a little lacklustre. Yet is still remains that as a main character, side characters such as Kim Sun Jae (played by Yoon Hyun Min) and  Shin Jae Yi (played by Lee Yoo Young) notably had greater  character-depth. Sun Jae went from an aloof and reserved detective, to a resound team player who learns to finally heal his emotional wounds in the process . His partner Gwang-Ho is his complete opposite, leading an oddly comical rivalry between the two characters. Refreshingly, however, Sun Jae wasnt pushed into this stereotype as the ' comic relief''- he is a character with his own profound and interesting backstory, which naturally slots in without feeling disjointed or odd at all in the overarching storyline .On the other hand, Jae Yi was a character who noticeably did not change by new revelations coming to light, but rather coming to accept the truth in the process . She is still an eccentric professor in the ending of the series  but she is certain upon confronting her past and identity. Her relationship with Sun Jae can be seen as a little and awkward in the grand scheme of the setup of the show, due to the striking personality differences between both characters and its presence in a thriller drama . Nevertheless their  relationship  did arguably over an intrinsic sense of closure for Jae Yi, as she is able to escape her fears of the past. In addition to the odd alliance and  partnership between the trio, there  is the more light-hearted dynamic between n Kwang Ho and Sung Shik (Jo Hee Bong) who was a rookie detective under Kwang Ho is the past, but in the present, he is Kwang Hos team leader and now older than him. Of course, this naturally to an onslaught of confused reactions when they begin reverting back to the terms they once used in the past, leading to moments of comical gold as the rest of their team look on in confusion. The writing, while it took its time laying down some groundwork, intrinsically lead to an interesting storyline. The identity of the killer and the antagonist is naturally the tuning point of the show, however, this was let down slightly by the problem of pacing. This is arguably the shows greatest weakness due to interesting storyline being reverted by a sense of  slow pacing and lacking speeds parts, however, when the show does pick up in certain moments, the aspects of ravaged grief and humanity can easily overwhelm the viewer. Ultimately,  Tunnel had a brilliant cast and an intriguing premise, however, it is important to note that this series  verges upon heavy-hitting issues typical of any noir  such as murder, fatalism and psychopathy on top.  The bittersweet ultimatum of the show will probably leave viewers slightly torn and the pacing does not always help to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Nevertheless, the characters  of the series are a life  line for  keeping viewers interested and whilst not intrisically flawless,  Tunnel is certainly a good watch."

You see everyone's side, feel everyone's side and realize everything happened for a reason. There are no bitter feelings for revenge. I never once felt mad at the husband or felt sad for the wife. Both gained so much from whatever they went through. It was worth it. 

Coming to characters. Choi Ji Woo was the reason I started this show. I have seen her previous dramas (most of them classic) and I was very curious as to how she'll pull off this character. She did a solid job. No Ra's journey of self-discovery was absolutely beautiful, even if the overall tones for it were very light. I cannot imagine anyone else for this part, she was flawless. 

The male lead, I loved him in My Daughter Seoyoung. He is so handsome. But he played a role I have never seen him in. He did not over-utilize that dimple (a first for me to see) and he played an agitated character. It was nice to see him play a role like this. The husband's role was wonderfully done. That balance between not liking him but still not disliking him was so marvelously done. The supporting cast was equally good. The son, the friends (such wonderful friends), son's girlfriend (she annoyed me but I get the need for her role). I felt Na Soon Nam and Park Seung Hyun needed more screen time and more depth though. They were great. 

The ost was decent.

Overall, it was really good. I love the kind of vibe TvN dramas give me. They always experiment with new ideas, sometimes even setting trends. It makes me feel like they make dramas because they love making them, they understand them. Instead of making dramas based on what we want, they make us understand what we want. That's just amazing. And Twenty Again lived up to that."

Dont get me wrong. I loved the whole series. I even understand why they chose that path. It was titled Twenty Five Twenty One so naturally i expected the story to peak when they were at that age.But come on!!! Why end it like that? For the better part of the whole series we are being teased to guess who will end up together in a mystery-solving setup - a la the Reply series. And then when it ended it wasnt even hinted who the father or the husband is. The kid is Kim Min Chae, after all so i kinda accepted early on that the father wasnt YiJin but to not answer it rendered the whole present timeline useless. They could have removed the present Hee Do and her daughter and it wont change a thing, because  they literally said its not important.The good:1. I loved the fencing (sports) main theme.2. Nam Joo Hyuk. Boy has improved so much, i may be inclined to think his handlers are doing everything to make him a multi awarded drama actor. It almost worked in Start Up, hopefully this is it.3.  Choi Hyun Wook. What a breath of fresh air. I loved him in RB, but he just shined here.4. Kim Tae Ri and Bo Na as Hee Do and Yu Rim, respectively . Beautiful and capable. Let me get back to this later.5. The coach, and the mother. I am inloved with Kim Hye Eun, makes me wanna see her past dramas.6. I liked the fact that it wasnt a fairy tale ending.The so-so.1. Kim Tae Ri. She is amazing in this role, but I get it, readers will hate me for saying this. There were some flak for the portrayal of a college student to a high school student love affair, it wasnt May December, but it was enough to make people think that high school HeeDo is way too young for an adult Yi Jin and at moments the idea is kinda cringy. I guess the producers thought, well Tae Ri is older than Joo Hyuk in real life so it shouldnt be an issue. My question however is, will the producers think differently if an early 20-year old actress was playing HeeDo? Also, like i said she did great here, but is there no actress who  is younger than Nam Joo Hyuk who can portray Hee Do's emotions? 2. The pacing and length of episodes. 16 episodes of almost 90 minutes each. Sometimes i feel like episodes are a little too long and the last 2 episodes in particular crammed too many issues a little too late. I guess thats how the format is for most asian drama - make the leads break up in the penultimate episode and then cram and jampack the finale to solve all the issues. But goodness i counted a few scenes that were a little too long that could have been used for some other things like how many times HeeDo and YiJin broke up and madeup. I guess they thought extending the drama and the crying scenes will make people cry. My short attention span went a little haywire. The bad 1. The older Hee Do. The actress portraying the older Hee Do is beautiful and i love the subtle acting that connects both the past and present HeeDo. BUT, is she really needed. Did the story changed by adding her character? Again, the non-reveal of the husband  made her character useless, and i felt like that was done to trick the viewers into keep guessing who the husband is going to be. Another thing, Hee Do's mother acted the older character. Why cant Tae Ri do the same?2. Hee Do's daughter Kim Min Chae. By the name alone, we know she is not Back Yi Jin's daughter. But still, her presence teased us with the possibility of Hee Do and Yi Jin endgame. But alas  they thought it wasnt important enough to be discussed. So why do we need the whiny kid.3. Now back to the ending. The whole series was great overall, but my heart needs closure. Would i reccommend? Definitely, just prepare to spend some time with it. Am i going to rewatch? Sorry, its just too long, and theres just too many drama nowadays i dont think i can. Kudos to Netflix for giving Asian dramas  chance to shine in a much bigger stage, makes my subscription very worthwhile."

It handled the story smoothly, keeping the pace hectic throughout the length of it. However, even though the drama wasn't boring because of it, it missed a lot of its charm, especially when it came to the love story. The romance on its own was kind of interesting, but felt undeveloped and rushed. The chemistry wasn't built and the love triangle was also half baked.The family drama, however, was pretty entertaining. The male lead's was overlooked at times, but the main one, between the mother and the daughter, was spot on. The second lead's story was disappointingly left unconcluded.Finally, the performances were okay. Wooseok did a nice job, but the character he was portraying, for me, was contradicted by his image. The leading lady was just there in the first part of the series, but she nailed her dramatic scenes. The side characters were delightful to watch.So, overall, six and a half out of ten."

(Unlike other short-length sports dramas I've been a fool to watch in the past) a great bromance,  the perfect amount and style of romance, and other issues such as teamwork, never giving up, fighting to the top of the ladder etc. which is quite prominent in this genre. The main things I liked about Two Hearts were the acting, characters and story: in that order from first to third. The acting has to be good with short-themed dramas, and everyone delivered above and beyond my (already high) expectations. There was a perfect blend of characters that gave a perfect balance of underdog athletes, jealous girls, genuine girls, strict coaches etc. which is what is needed in a sports drama. The story isn't the most unique but it is unique enough to warrant it a mention. It wasn't anything breath-taking, but it was admirable and it made me feel good. Two things that have decreased the rating for this drama: editing and directing, also, the fact that this will be quite a forgettable drama, which I can tell that it will be already, unfortunately. Editing and directing seem a little amateurish, and while the majority is fine, there are definite points where it is hard not to notice the mistakes or amateurish work.All in all, I do recommend watching 'Two Hearts'."

Is there any hope for Joon Young and No Eul to rekindle their past relationship?(Source: Viki)","Bae Suzy, Im Joo Hwan, Im Ju Eun, Jin Kyung, Kim Woo Bin, Yoo Oh Sung",KBS2,"A Problematic Tearjerker...  If you ask for a drama watchers recommendations of  saddest dramas theyve ever seen, it is probably likely that youll hear or see   Uncontrollably Fond ranked somewhere on that list. The series focuses upon successful superstar Sin Joon Young ( Kim Woo Bin) who awkwardly meets his old flame from  his youth, No Eul ( Bae Suzy), a producer of documentaries. When their respected careers awkwardly make their paths cross once again, No Eul is surprised to learn how much Joon Young has changed into a shallow and materialistic individual, rather than the kind-hearted person she once fell in love with, however, Joon Young also begins to stumble upon a life-changing truth which may finally ruin his relationship with his former love... Undeniably, Uncontrollably Fond isnt the type of drama to watch if youre looking for something fun and fluffy ;  the focal point of the series centralises upon  terminal illness, tragic love and angst with Lee Kyung Hees ( The Innocent Man, Chocolate) screenwriting hoping to tug at heartstrings of viewers , rather than relish in a sweet romance tale  (as shown in  his more light-hearted works).  The show is certainly effective within inflicting  heartache onto viewers  towards the particular fate of our characters, however, it is still certainly  problematic when it comes to characterisation,  as well as clearing up the evident inconsistencies which arose in this angst-ridden ride as well.It is important to note that the acting in the show is certainly quite good. Kim Woo Bin and Bae Suzy are undeniably brilliant actors, however, it is fair to say that their characters are tackled interestingly, to say the least. Bae Suzys character, No Eul is undeniably a kind-hearted soul who is passionate about her work and desperately tries to make amends with Joon Young over the course of the series . On the other hand, No Eul often felt too dormant within her actual role and presence as a fleshed-out individual onscreen. Whilst it is important to stress that a show doesnt necessarily need to go into a whole life story upon a character in order for viewers to  get to know them personally, its hard to really distinguish or get a grip upon No Eul as a character  outside of her  necessary flashbacks  and past relationship with Joon Young.  Even minor details such as her interests, interactions outside of her workplace and reactions to prominent obstacles over the course of the story , often felt passive and lacking in emotional depth to truly portray her as a well-written female lead.Then of course there is Kim Woo Bins  role as Joon Young. Undeniably Joon Young goes through several terrible ordeals even before the main events  of the series, which fundamentally shapes his certain outlook upon life, relationships and characters (No Eul, being the evident subject of Joon Youngs changed interactions and feelings). No Euls entry into Joon Youngs life again comes nearly  simultaneously with his life-changing news. This consequently causes him to try pushing No Eul away, as she becomes his saddening and haunting reminder of a past that hes tried to reject, and he can never return to. This of course leads us down two routes of  problematic characterisation; the first within Joon Youngs behaviour, and secondly towards this behaviour is inflicted towards the female lead No Eul . Its important to say that Joon Youngs reactions and attempts to drive No Eul away by flirting with other women, did add a slightly realistic reaction towards the male leads scenario. Joon Young is supposed to be only human and naturally intrinsically driven like most people towards rash decision-making. However,  Joon Youngs often anger-driven emotions and reactions towards his situation  by throwing things or beginning a screaming match, soon became both frustrating when he began to lash out at times upon No Eul. A lot of fans of Uncontrollably Fonds pairing  often seem to gloss over the fact that ,for the  majority of the series, Joon Young was emotionally abusive and physically harassed the female lead  upon several occasions ( not least throwing her out of the car in the middle of nowhere, grabbing her arm often without consent and often manipulating her feelings rather than merely being honest). Again, this is not saying it was  wrong for Joon Young to have feelings anger or for the show to touch upon emotional abuse or physical harassment, but it was concerning that the drama neither raised this up prominently as a terrible issue or relationships, and suddenly tried to  sweeten this by Joon Young and No Euls more  romantic feelings before the finale. This sudden transition from Joon Young tossing No Eul out of a car to hugging her  several episodes later, wasnt just nonsensical, but ridiculous in terms of character and relationship progression.Nevertheless,  despite the questionable relationship between the two characters, the finale did leave a sucker- punch for viewers feelings. Without spoiling too much, it is fair to say that upon reflection the ending isnt  sad per say because of the fate of our characters, but rather the blinded acceptance towards what is happening in their present, rather  than their pasts or futures. Overall Uncontrollably Fond wasnt a bad show with some well-written qualities of the psychological complexity of coming to grasps with terminal illness, relationships, love and an emotional ending. On the other hand, Uncontrollably Fond had little  greater character depth, straying away from cliches and explanations ( not least the  unexplained illness) ,a healthily progressive portrayal of relationships and problems of sugarcoating issues of emotional abuse and physical harassment within the main couple  as well. As a drama to pass the time and as a tearjerker , Uncontrollably Fond is undeniably a good-binge watch, however, if youre looking for a show with genuine depth and a well-written relationship between our leads, then look elsewhere because Uncontrollably Fond certainly isnt the one  that youre  looking for."

I haven't looked too into the review  for this one, but I can say my opinions towards it are very positive.To start off, I think it is incredibly underrated. The production of the drama is insane, and it is beautiful in every shot. Every shot is detailed and adds to the premise of the story, and none of what is shown is filler. It comes down to even the little moments that focus on hands,  rain,  etc. The cinematography is stellar and from a directing standpoint this drama is nothing less than that. What comes down to making this drama really good is all of the elements coming together. A lot of shows can have a good cast with a bad script, or a bad cast with a good script. This one pulls together what it had so well and is not overdone. The cast is pretty much star-studded, quite literally as you have SF9's Chani included as well.  I have seen some complaints about the secondary characters not being acted as well and that the main lead Kim Hye Soo is carrying the show, and to that I will explain. Kim Hye Soo is a veteran actress who has been doing this for years, and she is by far the best actress here. I can see that she may overshadow, but it is all the credit to her. She is just one of the best actresses out there and her co stars are young and haven't done it as long. What I am getting at is that she is amazing and the other acting isn't bad at all, she is just so so so good at acting that you might compare her to her co-stars.With that being said... I am pleasantly surprised by all the acting efforts of the whole entire cast. With some new faces that I haven't ever seen personally in a drama, none of them are over or underacting at all. The story is pretty easy to follow, a Queen's ambition for one of her sons to succeed and become a crown prince. The story may be simple, but every character is picked apart and that makes it very interesting.Each prince has their talents and things they are good at, but they are all very flawed. Each flaw gets its turn to shine, and each talent does as well. You can sympathize with even the princes that aren't directly the Queen's son. Every young person in this drama has a lot of weight held over them and they don't take the situation they are in lightly. The drama starts off lighthearted, but it descends to be deeper and more emotional. It's a story about family and survival, and a beautiful one at that.There are a lot of characters in this show and you would think I would forget a few or get lost. I haven't gotten lost at all, instead I grow further intrigued by each episode and scene with every character. The only complaints I have is the Queen Dowager... I hate bad people just thinking they are superior without having anything to back them up. She feels superior having put the King in his position. She wants to have everyone wrapped around her finger.. I dislike that woman so much honestly but that can't really be a complaint. It is credit to the drama for doing its job to make me dislike her. To wrap it up this drama is so good and I recommend for someone that wants a heartbreaking, heart-racing watch."

Even though, technically speaking, it deals with the same old story of corruption in politics, adding the Agency for National Security Planning and (basically) deserted agent made it a bit fresh. Sadly, the writers were incapable of writing intelligent main characters and villains. At the end, it was not about who outsmarts whom, but who will make more dumb mistakes. There were no winners, rather - bigger losers. Han Jung Hyun was probably one of the least consistent characters in the history of dramas. Presented as outstanding agent in the past, the future version of him made too many dumb mistakes for me to ever take him seriously. At some point I assumed that the Agency for National Security Planning only teaches and cares about fighting skills, because he barely ever used his brain. Then we have Im Hyeong Rak, another case of random nerve impulses - turning on and off his brain depending on what the plot needs. Mastermind that was able to cover up all his evil deeds for years and yet, he cannot predict the most predictable decisions Jung Hyun makes. He overlooks the most obvious course of action. True disappointment. That said, not all the characters were as bad. Choi Yeon Soo, even if boringly good, was fierce and smart, trying to work, limited by the rules set by corrupted people, to uncover the corruption. Then we have Do Young Geol, who was my favorite character - one of the most entertaining to watch. I wished the writers and director gave a little bit more attention and depth to his slowly growing internal conflict. Big props to the younger cast playing Jung Hyuns kids - solid performance. The plot itself could be better. It feels like there werent enough hints or clues leading to a plot twist to make it interesting, the bad guys were bad, the good guys were good. The guys that were at first good, without solid reasoning turned bad and I was just sitting in front of my laptop questioning everyones motives. There was not enough payoff from any of the plot lines. Overall, I think the burning frustration I felt while watching was the most entertaining part. The drama could be renamed Why yall like that?. When all the involved parties became aware of each other, and you would have thought the cat and mouse chase would start The drama ended. The last episode? Anticlimactic would be an understatement."

So Jang Hyuk's and Lee Ha Na's characters team up to catch a killer that murdered their family members. Both of them work at the emergency call center. That doesn't sound quite thrilling now, but let me tell you that the producers did a great job to get you excited about it immediately. Because the Golden Time (the first hours after a crime occurred and is reported to the emergency center) is one of the most crucial parts in hopefully solving a crime or prevent worse ones (i.e. kidnapping cases). And what is special here, is Lee Ha Na's character's ability to hear more than others. Due to an accident she developed some kind of supernatural hearing that allows her to hear more than others - even through headphones.

Right from the beginning the drama holds the suspense on a level that definitely makes your heart race. Fast camera movements and a good timing of scene editing ensure that. 

I can't say that this drama doesn't have any problems. It's still a k-drama and there are some flaws and again sometimes the police just looked stupid. You also have those characters who you want to punch because their behavior is so wrong when it comes to being professionals. But! There are also characters that I didn't like but who grew on me during the story, no matter that their behavior went into opposite directions. 

I also must admit that the story had some problems in the middle and lost some of its speed. I also think that the killer's identity was revealed too early in the drama which caused a big slow down as the story went a bit into some shady business themes. Although this doesn't mean that the killer's charisma wasn't engaging. He was a great psycho who gives you goosebumps.

The whole acting of the cast was fantastic. From the leads to supporting characters to guest roles. Especially the latter. They captivated me during their short appearances in the drama and made every single case into something special. I never found them boring. They were thrilling and emotionally moving. At some point they were even more interesting than the main plot.

The finale completely made up for the the middle part though. It picked up the speed and suspense again and let the drama end in an enthralling way."

While the story took a minute for it to grab me completely and my attention did fall off a bit at the end, the overall show was a really great mystery but was more-so used to set up the new main characters spot in the show. It establishes his overall backstory and sets up a story and more mysteries for season 3. The first one definitely is still my favorite so far in the series, season 2 stands alone as a great bridge between another hopefully great season.-- Spoilers Below --Director Kang comes back with such a bang that it really helped me remember why I loved this show so much. Her acting is incredible and she really makes you feel every emotion possible in such a short amount of time. Her character has grown a great amount being fully in charge of the Golden Time Team and making such a wave with it's success. She doesn't have too much of an interaction overall with the main mystery of the season, but is targeted by Officer Bang because of her gifted ears. Kang's chemistry with her new counterpart, Do Kang-Woo, is amazing and even though it's not a romance, had me slightly rooting for them to end up together. She fully understands and trusts him, but finds herself questioning her judgement many times at the hands of Officer Bang playing games with the entire team. I hope that she has more of an impact in the overall mystery and is more centered on her in season 3.Team Leader Do is a mysterious guy from the start and is definitely rough around the edges. Everyone around seems to dislike him and he has a dark past following him around. This season overall is establishing his character and backstory and setting up another storyline in season 3. The main mystery follows his backstory of his father being a serial killer and how it impacted himself, his family, and people around him. He suffers from PTSD from stumbling across his murdered friends body and his ultimately blamed by Officer Bang for this happening. The chemistry between him and Kang as stated is amazing and although he doesn't fully trust her with his past yet, he fully trusts her ears, gift and team completely. I loved seeing Eun-Soo getting more of a prominent role in the team and also being in charge when Director Kang steps out. She didn't get an episode in the first one, but sadly gets a tragic episode in this season. She is a victim of dating abuse and is in a violent relationship with a serial abuser. The story unfolds in a scattered way, but ultimately her abuser is murdered by 3 other women that he abused. Her acting in this episode is incredible and it shines on her characters development of how strong of a cop she is as a result of being with the Golden Time Team.Jin Seo-Yool was another new face to the Golden Time Team and filled in the place of Oh Hyun-Ho nicely. He is a computer hacking genius and helps the team get around the web fast. He gets an episode this season as well.. I feel as though it was used to not harm one of the main characters of the show but rather a new face that wouldn't really harm the overall story. Officer Bang plays with him and targets his hacking skills, eventually kidnapping him and taking all his fingers on one hand. I'm interested to see if he comes back for the third season and to see if there is any character development or story to come from that with his hacking and needing his hands for the job.Overall, this season could stand alone on it's own, but is a bridge between season 1 to the season to come. New characters equals new story and this season lays it all out. If you loved the stand alone episodes and procedures of the first season, you'll love this one as well. Though the main mystery is the drive of the season, I loved seeing the Team do what it does best. I can't wait to check out the 3rd season!"

I didn't review the second and third series because my reviews would've sounded the same because each premise was the same.Even though I watched all four within a two week span, I for some odd reason can't remember who the main male lead was in the second series. I didn't care for the main male lead in the third and I'm trying to figure out if I liked the main male lead in this one. I know I liked him in the Player and I dropped Black...that's probably why I feel the way I do about him in this series. I also didn't know why the creator had the same premise for some of the characters in all of these series meaning: main male lead was angry and didn't want to be apart of the Golden Time Team but ended up realizing it wasn't bad. Each character didn't believe the hearing ability of the female lead but began relying on her ability in the end. The computer geek who was able to find any everything when it was time and somebody within the police force was crooked. They might as well kept everybody the same in each series because they were the same.This along with the third installment barely dealt with side cases. It just dealt with them trying to catch the main villain which I didn't mind but I was so use to seeing different scenarios throughout the series and when that didn't happen, it made the series drag a little bit.My favorite character throughout the series was Kim Joong Ki even though I felt the writer did him a disservice by making him look like a lazy detective turned captain. He did nothing but shout into his ear piece and tell people where to go throughout the whole series. The other characters outshined him but he was still my favorite.Again this series had some take aways like the last three. The main female lead is suppose to have superb hearing but at times she couldn't differentiate the sounds she was hearing like a click of a lighter....If you're not vision impaired then you would know what a flicking lighter sound like without having to see it.The last episode wrapped up into what may look like a soon to be Voice 5. This is the first Korean drama that I've watched that actually had more than one series and it makes me happy.  I am however, not going to be happy because I don't know if this cliff hanger will actually turn into another series in the near future."

What a bad show.W, is basically a badly written drama about a badly written Manhwa coming to life.The moment I started watching W, suddenly a lot of my chores started getting done. I had finished my laundry, a novel worthy dissertation that was overdued suddenly got completed, my cupboards were clean and my room was sparkling. Soon I realized, that my mind's will to avoid the torture that this show subjected it to, was such; that it had me do all the things that I was procrastinating on since forever.However, the masochist that I am, I kept coming back to it. All these great reviews and high ratings made me think that the next episode would be surely better than the shit I just watched. I kept finding excuses for it and soon, the ending credits rolled in and the show finished being just as horrible as it was from the get go.To put it simply, W is like a rotten egg that somehow hatched into a headless chicken and proceeded to create chaos everywhere. It's like somebody took a coupla mindless plot-lines, threw it in a blender and went on to whisking it to hell and back.The plot makes no sense. The characters make no sense. The story makes no sense. The drama is essentially a hotchpotch of confused writing trying to mask itself as 'complicated'. So much is happening but you're reaching nowhere. And the worst thing of it all, is that despite all their efforts to try and have unnecessary events take place left and right; the show still remains boring as hell. Which is a shame because its premise was so unique and had a lot of potential.There are so many flashbacks and repetition, that half of the show is filled with the same old bs. Seriously, when you see Kang Chul get shot and Yeong Joo faint for the umpteenth of time, you're about ready to shoot and pass out yourself.However, for me as long as the acting is good I can forgive almost everything.No such luck here.Han Hyo Joo sucks so bad that she shouldn't even be allowed to act anymore. All she knows is to open her eyes wide like an idiot, cover her face with her hands and bite her nails. Literally, this is all she does throughout the show. Her acting (or lack thereof) is so monotonous that you can put a cardboard in her place and it would still work.I don't understand why Lee Jong Suk takes roles like these. I believe that this was probably his worst role as of yet, for there is no growth as an actor here. There is no denying his acting chops or his looks but playing a two-dimensional commonplace character like Kang Chul really dumbed down his potential.The dialogues often felt scripted and the actors seemed detached from the characters they were playing.The only memorable roles were the side characters. Yeong Joo's dad was brilliant, so was Park Bong So and the Mad Dog. All of them gave me some feels but the main characters were lacklustre at best.The kisses were good but the romance like the rest of the show was less than mediocre.I mean, the beginning was also bad but they really just lost their shit midway. It's like they didn't even care about following a logical story-line anymore.However, I want to really give credit to the actual Webtoon artists who drew all the manhwa chapters in the show. That's some serious talent there, not gonna lie, but that's about it.16 hours of total waste, watch it only if you want to have your intelligence insulted.Enjoy!"

Wistful, storytelling, peaceful, weird sound cuts. It has a few Korean drama moments of surprise. 
Woori is surprisingly fierce and determined to get what she wants. She's also no blushing idiot. 
Well, she does become a bit of an idiot as the show goes on. But I like her face. She's so pretty!  
I like that moment when Woo Young looks into her room and sees she's not in there. Captures a real human moment of looking at someone's area/possession and feeling that emptiness or that wondering of where they are. 

Woori's new boy toy helps her out of every kind of scrape. He's doormat material until Woo Young challenges him. The male ego. So amusing to me."

Let's start with the plot. A boy and a girl meet at the hospital. He's been severely depressed since he found out his father blamed him for his mother's death. He already felt guilty about it but that was the last straw which pushed him deeper. The girl suffers from bipolar disorder and is on medication. They both do not talk to their parents, spend too much time alone and therefore consider themselves trash. One day in hospital they come upon a poster announcing a recycling class ""We are not trash!"" They participate and learn to recycle.This drama was sponsored by Korean ministry of environment so I fail to grasp the relation between mental health and recycling. I do not know if other people with mental health problems consider themselves trash like the two main characters here.  So I guess they want to say that everything (one) is useful even the things (people?) who are broken. The running theme in a big number of dramas is the lack of communication between teens and their parents. And even though eventually the boy's father tells him how important it is to say things to other people, to tell them about feelings, he  himself is reluctant to do it. It seems that everything needs to be brought to the brink of destruction, in order for people to realize that the communication is the clue!This is a typical short web drama, with a lot of narration, as usual. The pacing is correct, the actors are talented and had chemistry while portraying teens looking for answers. And again, as always, so much drama could be avoided if people only talked to each other. Nevertheless, this was a nice short watch, not too heavy and rather cute!"

From a writing perspective, its closer to a 7.5, but I had so much fun, I cannot rate it lower than 8.5. It was quite an exciting watch, delivering all types of frustration and thrills, but ending on a rather mediocre note. Honestly speaking, the first half of the show was a good 10/10. It had everything one might want from a show like this - cute fighter, psycho brain, cinnamon roll who just wants to help. Weve also got all the blood, pain, violence and the main character - the pen! I was eating it all up, could not stop watching and barely stopped myself from screaming at my laptop.So what happened in the 2nd half? The drama changed from more plot/action driven to character driven and it focused on the character I honestly cared the least about. With each and every scene I just started to hate him more and more. For all the buildup, all the tension, all the accumulated frustration in me, I was not delivered a proper closure. I understand it will have a second season, but even with that, rather than being excited and hopeful the drama left me fearful if they will deliver a more proper ending this time. I dont want to dive into it and get a half baked potato with the last scene.That said, the show presented a glorious friendship/bromance between Shi Eun and Soo Ho and I could not ask for more on that part. Both characters perfectly played off of each other's traits and the dynamic was just fun to watch. They were perfect partners in crime. Oh Beom Seok was a complicated character and I dont think the director quite well delivered what they planned with him.  I feel like there was something missing with the way his character was developed. For such complex internal and external struggles, I was completely indifferent to whatever was happening to him - which is ridiculous as he is the center of last 4 episodes. Plot wise, saying this drama lacks realism would be a massive understatement. Some scenes were so ridiculous and over the top I was just laughing. At times it was even hard to feel bad for these kids, because the situations they were in just made little sense. And this is one of the reasons I enjoyed the show. I watched it for the over the top scenarios. I wanted excitement and hype, and not pain and anxiety. That said - fear not, Weak Hero Class 1 still manages to create decent stakes and make you care for the characters, even if your brain sees the nonsense happening on the screen. I appreciate how the drama tried to showcase what happens when someone is in a circle of violence. What they missed is to show why some characters were able to get out of it, while others got swallowed deeper and deeper. Production value was good. Loved the fighting scenes, and loved the different approach the characters had to them. They delivered realistic blood and realistic amounts of it - someone gets punched, they will bleed, but aint no bloody waterfalls going on. Some scenes were quite aesthetically pleasing, though I wished they included more visual symbolism here. This is something I felt like the drama lacked. The acting was the one that surprised me the most, on the positive note. I knew Park Ji Hoon is good and that's why I am even more amazed he delivered even more than I expected. This type of character so so easy to mess up. To create the aura of intimidation, you need some skills. to make him look empathic on top of that, is even harder. And Ji Hoon managed to do it all. Choi Hyun Wook was honestly adorable. That said, I kind of felt like this is more violet, better at fighting version of the character he played in 2521. Hong Kyung did a great job with the character he was given. Even if the writing for him felt rushed, he did great at portraying the change and desperation. Overall, fun, violent and exciting. The characters were interesting, some more and some less likable. The conclusions for specific plots and situations could have been better. Perfect binge watch material."

Most, if not all dramas, fit into one of these two categories. It`s very seldom you`d find a drama that encompasses both sentiments, but I hoped ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo"" would be that drama. Unfortunately, my expectations were half met. This drama certainly can be categorized and it falls in the category of pure sweet entertainment.As I like to preface all my reviews by saying that I`d first like to highlight positive sides of every drama, I`ll do the same here. I`m a firm believer of firstly giving praises to the cast, director, writer and everyone else involved because it is not easy to make a drama(this coming from a writer). So, what did I enjoy in ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo""?Well, first of all, the cinematography is clean and very competent. It`s bright and fits the overall mood of this drama excellently. The OST also does a great job of amplifying the vibe this drama is striving for. It`s fun, at times eclectic and it`s just on the cusp of being repetitive, but not quite. The characters of Bok Joo`s father and her friends are definitely the best for me when it comes to comedy. As most people can guess by my watchlist, I`m not big on slapstick or drama comedy in general, but there were a few moments I found genuinely funny and it was coming from the aforementioned bunch. And I also appreciated that they used actors of all body types, which I rarely see in Korean dramas(wish they had the same approach when it came to choosing our main character but alas).As for the chemistry between our leads-it`s free-flowing, mostly natural and clearly generated(meaning that the chemistry wasn`t underdeveloped nor forced, which I greatly appreciate). I did hear it was due to the fact that these actors were dating for a few months while filming this drama and it shows. Their moments of romance, though stereotypical, range from serviceable to your-cheeks-hurting cute. Joon hyung is a great male lead and I related to him the most throughout this drama. He`s charming, but emotionally intelligent enough to not be discarded as just another bland flirt. Their relationship reminds of those high school sweethearts links. Which is cute in isolation, however, my mind suddenly came to a conclusion that these people were supposed to be around my age. Thus shock settled.Now we come to my gripes with this drama. And many come from the title character herself. Kim Bok Joo. And this is a weird one for me. The character of Bok Joo STARTED OFF as somewhat of a female version of Dongman(from ""Fight My Way""). They are both impulsive, easily excitable and quick to fall deeply for someone. And then, along the way, she became this unidentifiable identity. And I`m convinced that this is due to some questionable writing we are presented with. While I can admit that she is not a typical female drama lead, to say that Bok Joo`s a good posterchild for breaking stereotypes of femininity and female form in dramas is an overstatement. While skimming through some of the comments previous reviewers left, I realized that even I semi-agree with them. And I say even, because I like to think I`m not extremely difficult in suspending belief if need be. But, um Lee Sung Kyung was not a good pick for this role, when it comes to the character herself(again, couple chemistry-GREAT). She simply does not look nor is she convincing as a responsible weightlifter who`s (extremely) immature for her age. And I get that casting plays a role in this, there aren`t a whole lot of muscular women(none well-known) who could play the main character. Even still, having her dress in oversized clothing to push the idea of someone who she`s clearly not really weirded me out. And that`s even before diving into her actual character, who`s so, so confusing. As an established responsible character with a hardworking family, it really rubbed me the wrong way how easily she settled for paying exorbitant amounts of money in order to just see her crush. But I chalked that one up to messy first love(I guess). But then she also hid her budding relationship with Yoon hyung for no actual reason. Like, it actually thematically makes no sense and it made me sad for Yoon hyung who was actually great in his pursuit. Finally, instead of empowering me and other women who do not fit the society`s and much less drama`s version of femininity, Bok Joo simply came off as a confused child, prancing around aimlessly. Another complaint I have, and is the main problem for me, is unfortunately the length of this drama and how much they decide to focus on the ex-girlfriend to fill this empty time frame. IT`S RIDICULOUS. Even I, who is all for character development, had enough because they weren`t presenting any new facts by episode 10-they were just reiterating what we already know. Again, this drama would`ve been much more enjoyable if it was a 10 or 12 episodes show, rather than 16. For the kind of story it presents and level of character development we do get, it`s too, too long. Not to mention they lose a bit of momentum with our main couple because they get together in episode 11. I`m all for slowburn romances but for the type of drama this wound up being, it`s too longwinded.In the end, ""Weightlifting Fairy Bok Joo"" was a mess, but an enjoyable one. However, it definitely deserves a lesser spot, because the one it currently holds is kind of ridiculous. Would recommend for an easy watch, but not much beyond that."

When I started episode one I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a a story-line.

Character wise well...don't hate me but AOA's Chanmi wasn't very good at acting. It may have just been her part or it could just be because this was her first drama. The female lead was alright, she's had more experience as an actress. As for Hongbin and Hakyeon, well they were fine. Hongbin's character confused me the most, I don't even know how to explain how confusing it was. Hakyeon again gets stuck playing the poor character, but he is super smart money wise in this.

The story-line made me so freaking confused. Maybe it would make more sense if I knew something about saving money or any money terms? Maybe that's the point of this drama, to get you to think about saving money? But literally out of nowhere in the last episode they play a game about money terms and everything that happens in that episode was just confusing. I felt like they just threw this plot-line together the day before shooting and was like ""let's roll with it.""

Music wise I only remember the ending theme song, it was a pretty decent song. However I've only found it available on iTunes.

So far this does not help out my disliking towards web-dramas.

I think the four star could've done much better with a better story-line!

The last two episodes are where it faltered for me. Park Seo Joon was flawless here, and I can't complain about him in any way. And the comedy was gold. I wasn't disappointed with the final moments, but I would say that episodes 15 and 16 were pretty much completely filler material as they had run out of story and needed to stretch the time. I've been known to comment that I would be happy just watching my OTP be happy and in love, but it turns out that I do, in fact, need to see some actual story - even if it's weak. LOL!Again, PSJ can pretty much do no wrong in my eyes right now. He's pretty to look at, has good comedic timing, and his romance scenes were believable and tingle-inducing. Who else could make such an arrogant guy lovable and sweet? Park Min Young - started out really well. She looked sharp, had pretty smiles, and great bantering. And my goodness- THAT PONYTAIL!! Props to the ponytail! :) But I wasn't always fully convinced of Mi So's affections towards Young Joon because of how PMY acted. I've not read the webcomic that this is based on, so I don't know how true the adaptation is to the source material. In the last two episodes, her passiveness toward Young Joon was awkward and lacked any of the passion that had been building from the rest of the story. Pyo Ye Jin as Ji Ah, was super cute, but she seems to have been typecast into similar roles now. I did enjoy her in this and hope to see her in more roles soon. Hwang Bo Ra as Bong Se Ra was a bit over the top in her comedy like she was trying way too hard. But both Ji Ah and Se Ra's office romances were very cute and fun to watch. Kang Ki Young did a great job in his role, playing Young Joon's employee and friend....but mostly his advice coach. Lee Tae Hwan, playing Young Joon's brother, was such a mild character that he was virtuously unnoticeable and fairly useless except as a plot device. The story was thin and didn't fill out the available time for the story, but because I was enjoying the romance it didn't become super obvious until the last couple of episodes. I enjoyed the banter and the comedy between the co-workers and the romance between Young Joon and Mi So. I found the sound effects hilarious and Mi So's side eye made me laugh every time. Although the secondary romances were fairly cute, there is little substance to this show, if I'm being perfectly honest. I am all up for fluffy and light when it comes to romantic comedies- so this fits that perfectly for that. If you expect a rom-com to be anything other than this, you will be disappointed and I wouldn't recommend it. I was happily entertained for the majority of the show, though, regardless of the plot. (I'm not difficult to please when it comes to rom-coms.) I could see myself re-watching parts of this show one day when I want something light and cute."

As a freshman at the college of music, Ji Soo didn’t expect to catch the eye of Han Jae Hyun, a popular, headstrong law school student, but she did. Falling for him as quickly as he fell for her, the two experienced one of the most beautiful moments any two people can experience together: their first love.  But like so many first loves, theirs wouldn’t last forever.Now in her forties, Ji Soo is a single mother, working a contract job in a desperate attempt to make ends meet. Jae Hyun, on the other hand, is a successful, ambitious businessman who has pursued wealth and honor, above all else. Far different than the man he once was, Jae Hyun is hardly recognizable as the headstrong kid he used to be. But when fate brings Ji Soo back into his life, she recognizes him almost immediately.Suddenly back in each other’s lives, Ji Soo and Jae Hyun have been granted a rare opportunity to start over. But can two people really separated by so many years and experiences, really reignite a flame that flickered out so many years ago?(Source: Viki)","Jeon So Nee, Lee Bo Young, Moon Sung Geun, Park Jin Young, Park Shi Yeon, Yoo Ji Tae",tvN,"Good stuff. Complex. Powerful at times. Yet you better dont set the primary focus on the romance. No idea why the international title is what it is... so beware! If you're expecting a love story here, you'll get one, but certainly not in the way you thought it would. With their motifs and soft focus, the posters for the KDrama also promise more heartbreak of the shallow kind than the story does justice to.The original title ""The most beautiful moment in life - the moment when life becomes a flower"" describes the moment in which life (not love) acquires meaning, beauty, direction, form and can blossom. And here we are closer to the topic. The two protagonists have been in love with each other since their student days in the 90s. Yes. But it has grown through their attitude to life, the meaning they give to their own lives, through their principles and quite specifically through the class struggle, the union struggle, the demonstrations for more democracy. By boldly standing up for what they believe in, life is transformed into a (bright, fragrant, inspiring) flower.To reduce life and its beauty to love would not be enough. But love is definitely part of it - just like water or the sun - to let these flowers (which can/want to be a person's life) grow. This flower reveals its inherent beauty in the creative expression of what is important to you, what you stand for, what you believe in.In that sense, Yoon Ji-soo's seedling came to life after she met Han Yaeh-hyun during his pro-democracy and workers' rights protests. Ji-soo's enthusiasm for Yaeh-hyun's cause didn't go unnoticed for him either.-------------- SIDE NOTE: ---  Early unionists, political protest and rebellion against injustice ---We are learning about South Korean democracy movement when it was still in its infancy. During the decades of the dictatorship, conservative politicians skillfully exploited the fear of the communist north and consistently interpreted or pursued any commitment to workers' rights as a communist threat. Strikes and demonstrations were always uncompromisingly dispersed and participants and leaders sentenced to prison terms. Even recently, in the last 5 years, trade unionists, fighting for workers' rights, have been and continue to be arrested for ""offences against public order"". In the case of convictions of corporate bosses/Jaebeol, a pardon usually follows quickly. Unionists, however, always have to serve their long sentences. Recently, for example, the KCTU chairman Han Sang-gyun was sentenced to three years in prison during an organized mass rally for workers' rights (2016) and Jang Ok-gi from the construction workers' union was imprisoned for a protest march for higher pensions for non-permanent construction workers (2017).---------------So the context of this love story is quite serious. And the KDrama cleverly wraps and links this 'seriousness' around the love plot of the two protagonists. The story is told in time leaps between then and now. It tells how Ji-soo's father (head of the district attorney's office) opposes the young love, it tells about Yaeh-hyun's father's unsuccessful struggle for workers rights, about Jaebeol Jang Sang, into whose family Yaeh-hyun marries, and about the unscrupulous intrigues of father and daughter, as well as the elite family of lawyers that Ji-soo married into. It tells of the intolerable arrogance of the wealthy towards the lower-income classes, which continues in the form of bullying among their children. It tells of courageous class struggle and rebellion against injustice. It tells of the almost hopeless struggle for one's own rights in the face of powerful opponents. And that it's never too late to let the flower of your life bloom.So, should you watch it? Yes, its good stuff. Complex. Powerful at times. But dont set the primary focus on the romance. Otherwise you might be a bit disappointed."

I love everything about this series, and I love that they used the same cast, even adding a few additional characters. This season was equally as good as the first season, and I'm so proud of how this came out. Starting off with the basics;Story: (9.5) I loved the storyline so so much, and I think the writers did a really good job in showing how each character just accepted themselves for who they were at some point. I think the writers did a really good job in adding a LGBTQ+ character, despite how rough the korean public can be at times towards gay roles. One thing that did tick me off a little bit was probably Yumi's character. She honestly made me upset at times, but it also showed me that not all seemingly perfect people are actually perfect. They may be suffering something that you can not see. I personally think that her problem was a serious mental health issue, and most people overlook it because characters with inferiority complexes tend to be annoying, but it is actually a serious issue that affect a lot of people. I think the actor portrayed her role so well, and really showed how she matured and grew throughout the story.Acting/Cast: (10) If I could go higher, I probably would. I loved the cast and their chemistry so so much. I was really rooting for Seon Ho and Joo Hyuk, but I guess not everything goes the way you want it to. I'm so glad that there was a LGBTQ+ character. I really didn't think it would happen since the korean public is still a little touchy about that subject, but I'm really glad that they added Seon Ho in because he really did such a good job confusing me. I had no idea whether he liked Joo Hyuk, Soo Rin, or Gu Seul! I'm really happy with the chemistry of all the actors, and I think Shin Se Hwi portrayed Yumi very well. Music: (10) Not much to say for this, since I didn't really notice any music but a 10 it is. Rewatch Value: (9.0) I took off a whole point just because I wouldn't be able to stand watching Yumi being bitchy to Soo Rin, but watching them make-up and Yumi backing up Seon Ho's bullies made me feel so much better. I will come back to this drama, maybe skipping a few episodes or so, but I will definitely rewatch this someday. Overall: (9.5) This web drama was overall just really really good so you guys should give it a try. It really shows how you should learn to accept yourself and love yourself. This drama really teaches valuable lessons, and I think you should really give this a try. The full series is on Youtube, go and support it, it's worth it, I promise! Happy watching!"

I've always been a big fan of Gong Hyo Jin and she has been amazing here, she has shown (once again) that she has quite the acting range. The rest of the actors were great too, especially Hyangmi, but there are no -acting related- weak points really. It's worth noting that this is a very pretty show, the cinematography is just excellent.Onto the bad stuff:One of the biggest problems with this drama is that they've extended it to 20 episodes, all the filler stories that were used to fill up the additional 4 episodes were related to things I usually don't enjoy watching in a kdrama, namely Confucianism crap and an incredible amount of melo. I'm fine with watching melodramatic scenes in general, but this was just way too much, for way too long. There is also a shift in writing after XYZ's death, it's like all my favorite things in the show got dialed down to the bare minimum. Some characters got some personality & intelligence adjustments mid way and then in the finale everyone suddenly changed their world views for a super fast ending that was quite underwhelming. To sum it up the pacing is just off. The disadvantages of live filming were on a honking display here. Oh I almost forgot, the 30 million won thing, I have no words for how stupid that was..So why do I still rate the show at 7.5?Well, I enjoyed the first half (more like 2/3rds), there was quite a lot of  ""Monogatari style"" dark moody, but funny dialog. The romance was great up to the point when Yongsik's mother started interfering with them. The balance was perfect between romance,comedy and mystery too up until XYZ died. Even though I'm not happy with the last 6~ episodes, I would feel bad to give a show this memorable a score any less than this."

The first half was so poignantly and beautifully written while the second half was just plain bad writing. The music was phenomenal with stunning instrumental and heartwarming lyrics, yet the drama used those songs so repetitively that I got sick of them a little bit by the end. The acting was unbelievably amazing and yet, there was a lot of over done theatrics.I cried, laughed, cared so much, and yet there were times where I was bored out of my mind. It appeared quite sunny and cheerful on the surface but it had a lot of deep, dark psychological elements to it. The main character Ha Rip (Jung Kyung Ho) is goofy, sexy, mean like a feral kitten and oh so adorable and yet his actions were greedy, desperate, selfish and downright awful. It's painfully slow at times and yet it moves so fast in others. It's horribly predictable in one episode and then there's mind fuckery waiting for you the next.It's both so good and so bad. Depending on which you choose to focus on, the drama will become that for you.Despite all the bad, I personally enjoyed my time with it. I forged a connection with all the characters and felt so sentimental in almost every episode. I wish it was better written and all the unnecessary draggy parts to stretch the episodes weren't added but I felt like the cast did their best with it and it showed.P.S Jung Kyung Ho. Enough said."

I'm not usually a fan of stories that drag, but now that I completed the drama I see that this is one case where the pace actually adds to the storytelling. If you can handle it, keep watching and you will find yourself drawn into life in this small town during the winter and to spring, and all of it's quirky characters. You will also get to enjoy a love story with amazing chemistry.  Once more of the story was revealed I went from boredom to an eagerness to see what would happen to these characters I grew to care about. That has a lot to do with the phenomenal cast.This drama stars Park Min Young as Hae Won. Hae Won's POV is how we slowly (very slowly) get introduced to this town. She is cold, and super emo, so don't expect a completely lovable character, but I found her performance to be super realistic, and I empathized with her even when she frustrated me. I'm not surprised that she was so good (she's one of my favorites), but I am surprised that she had such great chemistry with Seo Kang Joon, who I initially thought was too young for her.  They were perfectly matched from the very beginning, whether their scenes were awkward, cute, sexy, or intense. There is also a lot unsaid between them, and lots of staring , which would get old quick with lesser actors. I just loved how they played off of each other so well no matter the mood of the scene. Kang Joon also plays Eun Sub as mysterious so effortlessly but also showed awkward vulnerability in a way that made me fall in love with his character quickly and look forward to seeing him on screen, even if he was just making coffee (very slowly lol).  This isn't your typical romance, but I think romance fans with patience will get the payoff of seeing a great love story between two loners struggling with their own complicated pasts. Warmth in this drama isn't just about the weather, it's about how they are able to warm each other emotionally, and that feeling between them is palpable. It also gets HOT at moments which I appreciate!The rest of the cast truly is also amazing, and really makes the town feel 100% real. One good thing about the pace is that it gives time for the supporting cast to also be portrayed as complicated well-developed characters, whether I loved or hated them. So many of the supporting characters got me in the feels... Mom and Aunt in the matching sunglasses (my favorites),  Eun Sub's parents and hilariously obnoxious little sister, The book editor, The frienemy, The book club, and goofy but reliable Lee Jang Woo... eventually I felt like I knew the whole town well, and along with the gorgeous shots of the scenery, it felt like a welcomed vacation from coronavirus quarantine. At times it was almost a PSA for social distancing (physically and mentally lol)!As for the story, I do think it is well done, with great attention to detail when it comes to relationships, and even a bit of suspense, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't struggling during the first episodes which mostly set the mood more than moving the story forward. It almost feels more like a stage play at some points. Still, it is definitely original and I had no idea where the story would lead, which was great, The music, while a perfect fit, also makes taking a nap during this drama very tempting. The Good Night Club confessional blog also felt a little much at times, although it does allow us to see more into Eun Sub's thoughts, especially about ""Irene"". For me, the pace picked up once Mom showed up, or at least there was much more focus on the overall story, and I no longer felt the urge to nap from then on. Not that the mood every really changes completely, the tone is moody and even calming throughout.So, would I watch this again? I'm sure I will. I do think that now that I have connected to the characters and know what's going on, that the slow beginning would be more enjoyable the second time, and I'll no longer be confused by moments that didn't matter to me out of context. I still think some things could have been introduced or resolved in a way that dragged less, and maybe fewer flashbacks initially, but I still respect the overall pace because of the mood and atmosphere it helped to create. Overall, I was uncertain at first, but this may be the perfect drama to watch while stuck at home. Don't expect a lot of action, a major villain, or even melodrama, because this story is driven by relationships and character development. I did love the themes of healing through emotional warmth and affection, struggles with forgiveness, or even the comfort in expressing themselves at the multigenerational bookclub.  To me, this was a wonderful love story but it also explored all the different ways love can look, even when it seems like love is not there.  I laughed, I cried, I felt butterflies and wanted to scream at the screen at moments, so I would never call this drama boring as a whole. I recommend giving this drama a chance. It won't appeal to everyone, but the slow but steady vibe definitely won me over!"

The main lead just felt TOO tied to the twin sister, and it honestly never felt like he even liked LEB. When second lead found out she went back to Love House, he went all the way there and main lead...did nothing? Seriously  two sisters, two guys. The math could've worked out perfectly, come on.Instead, I cared a lot more for the mystery part, but it felt like it just sort of unraveled by itself, with everyone suddenly doing things voluntarily and there not really being any repercussions for it. Another thing I wanted badly was for LEB to get her satisfying ending with her new family and friends, but it felt like we never got the satisfying confrontation between her and the antagonist. Instead, it felt like GEB did all the heavy lifting there  which is helpful and fun to watch, but misses the entire point of LEB's character arc to finally stand up for herself now that she has a strong support system. I never felt like the antagonist hit rock bottom (usually the most satisfying moment) when her character could've had so much more personal growth.And part of that is that the reveal of the twins to the class which I was anxiously waiting for turned into an ""oops"" moment. Upsetting, because I'm a sucker for a badass reveal scene.It also felt like the show tried to handle too much  essentially it didn't FEEL like a school drama, which usually focuses a lot on school issues like day-to-day bullying, cheating, parental pressure. There was some of it but it was all in the side characters and I felt like I was watching two different dramas. There was also a serious lack of teacher-student sentimentality, which is one of my favorite parts of school dramas. I think this could've been explored in the sister of the student who died; her character was reduced to a catalyst in the plot, when I thought it could've been so interesting if she had actually started caring for the students who she was supposed to be getting revenge on and had to feel that internal conflict."

Does it offer anything new to the table of evil powerful men do bad **** and abuse their power to their own benefit... not really, but it is still interesting to watch how creative writers can be at finding ways to write evil... You know just when you thought you had seen some really evil men then you watch this and see oh that is another way to be evil... manipulative... and so on and so on.So if you are like me and enjoy a dose of evil now and then this is definitely a drama worth watching. If you are in it for the noona romance... you will probably find this drama lacking, not in  terms of chemistry of lovable male lead but in build up and screen time for the actual romance aspects of the drama as the drama Big Mouth that is not listed as a romance has a lot more romance than this drama does, so yes it has some romance but not enough to satisfy the romance lovers out there. There are a bunch of sweet, sweet top tire friendships, in this drama, a hint of bromance, a trio and sisterhood so good it will make you swoon.. okay maybe not swoon but definitely lovely to watch. There are a few annoying elements here and there, the female leads family is annoying as ****  and the way they show sorrow is well executed by the actors but a bit over the top, I blame the director for this. There is a also a bunch of cringy dialog here and there... The pace is fast in the beginning having me say ""Oh that escalated quickly""  in more or less every episode during the first half.  However fast pace meant also fast  wrap up (rushed), at times if feels like they are trying to fit in just a little bit to much evil without really taking care of all the evil they send our way... adding twists just for the sake of twisting that feel just unnecessary.  So if you like evil go for it...  if not move a long and watch something else. bingabilaty- high, heart flutter- low, emotional stuff -low... plot -decent... round up- rushed."

Witch's Court seemed, on the outside, like a dream come true for me. A law and crime drama, paired with a kickass heroine and a dash of romance? What could possibly go wrong? It was one of my highest anticipated dramas of 2017 and I was expecting that first episode in and I'd be ready to give it a solid 10. However, as I watched the series, one by one all my hopes came crashing down.The drama's worst flaw was its lack of an original plot. The fact that it was extremely badly written with a truck load of plot-holes and stroppy pacing, didn't help the case. From the first episode to the last, I guessed everything that was going to happen. It was such clich, same old bs that at one point, I was even correctly predicting the character's dialogues before they spoke them. I saw plot-twists coming from miles ahead. I knew exactly what the main leads were going to do and how they were going to do it. Trust me, it ain't a nice feeling when you're ten steps ahead of your main leads.Some people say that a show is only as good as its antagonists and that is one another point where Witch Court loses out on. From the daily episodic rapists to the main antagonist, all the villains were less than mediocre and slight variations of one another. It's like they were trying way too hard to be evil but unfortunately, ended up being cheesy instead.You know how when kids do something bad, like steal a cookie and you ask them about it and they're all innocent smiles to your face but the moment you turn your back, they start smirking mischievously, triumphant that they managed to ''fool'' you? That's exactly how the bad guys were in this show.The cringey smiles and 'evil laughs' they gave behind our main lead's back just added to their extra personalities and not in a good way. I mean how many times before have we seen a story about a corrupt Mayor in power being the villain, acting all nice and kind infront of the camera? Too many times to count. Bring me something new, please.All the side characters were poorly constructed, barely making any contribution to the plot. At first, I was very intrigued by our male lead. He seemed like a breath of fresh air, unlike the typical macho alpha assholes. He was supposed to be this smart, gentlemanly guy who actually gave our heroine the upperhand. How amazing, right? Not really. Even though he is made out to be different from all the other drama male leads, the show still shoves him into the 'cool tall neighborhood oppa' stereotype. I'm always amazed when everyday prosecutors adopt ninja fighting skills out of nowhere. But those things were the least of his problems, because as the show progressed he became increasingly annoying. I love my upright handsome guys who're adamant to uphold the law but, Prosecutor Yeo was just all talk and no show. He had the classic 'dumb but heroic' vibe throughout. Way too self-righteous and equipped with dramatic declarations, he didn't do any of the actual work and soon became a pain in the ass I could really do without.Even though the show is tagged 'romance' there was nothing of that sort here. The main couple had no chemistry and they just seemed like regular colleagues on good terms.Surprisingly, the show did its flashbacks fairly well but like I mentioned before, the pacing was shit. Things that needed to be drawn out and be dramatic were so anti-climactic and things that needed to be rushed on were dragged out.Some things that happened were so questionable because they were far out of the sphere of logic. Most of the times, our prosecutors won the cases because of convenient plot devices instead of actual smarts.So seeing all these flaws, it's quite just that I rate it low right? But why then, does it pain me so much to do so? Well the answer is: Ma Yi Deum.The heroine of this show was undeniably the saving grace. She was the only thing unique about the otherwise run-of-the-mill drama. Watching her antics was absolute bliss. Jung Ryeo Won brought forth a character that was extremely real and relatable. Often, I felt like she was my soul sister considering how many similarities I had with her. This is also why she was so easy to connect with.I loved the fact that she went through life staying true to herself and not giving a fuck about what people thought. Even though, at times, she acted like she was all over the place, in reality she was a very composed and strong woman. Her face remained impassive in the worst of situations and she always had some clever tricks up her sleeve. Her bright smile, dark red lipstick and bad hair cases gave me so much life.She was the one making the show, for every second she went off-screen the show turned utterly boring. Ma Yi Deum was so lovable and a character that I'll always remember. This is the reason why, even though I have a lot of problems with this show I still reccomend it so that other people can witness Prosecutor Ma's quirky weirdness and like me, be thoroughly entertained by it too.The fact that the show revolved around rape cases is something I found to be commendable. Rape is a taboo topic and people often hesitate talking about it so openly and this show (while not perfectly) still managed to bring some fairly brutal cases on the forefront and that effort needs to be acknowledged. The OST doesn't really stand out but the instrumental that plays at Ma Yi Deum's badass moments was really good.I hope who ever reads this considers this review a good thing, instead of being let down because this will lower your expectations and then when you do end up watching the show you'll be pleasantly surprised.While this is not a drama you can go in with the thought that your high hopes will be met, it is definitely a good time-pass.Enjoy!"

There are some truly 'melo' and makjang things that happen in the first few episodes, but there is a nice comedy to it that kept me interested. But the downfall to this drama was that it dropped a bunch of important storylines and started to become repetitive.

The plot is all over the place. They have one or two actors that are up to par and the rest or horrible. Either the facial expressions are exaggerated or the entire presentation is just off. Then you will see its one-sided, but thats if you should happen to get past the horrible acting. One character with no backer whatsoever becomes more intelligent than the 1%. -It's a reason the 1% is just 1%.- She has no history that includes anything to warrant her success rate in the business, education, finance, and or mental and physical backing that allows her behavior. However, she somehow gets to practically overthrow, kill, destroy, and manipulate an entirely successful and rich family for 70-80 episodes. Why do I say that? Granddad with no help became a powerhouse which means he had to have some intelligence to get that far. Even if he had a leg up, he still grew that company and made it what it was. So, you are telling me that Granddad is slow to someone like AeRa?! If, a show has 100 episodes, and nearly 80 or horrible, its not a win. One character has been the center of attention, and no, its not who you think; its the antagonist. The antagonist here wins for nearly 80-85% of the show. The shows name should be changed to Evil Resides in A Chaebols Bedroom. Because lets be honest if this was boxing and the opponent had managed to land a few punches in the last 4.7 minutes of the match. Then out of 47 minutes, he would still lose.

Supposed to be based on a true story but I am not sure. It starts out a bit slow which I have found is the norm for Korean dramas. Had some characters that were not too believable in the drama but they were supporting cast.  The daughter's role was very mature and intellectual. One part that I disliked totally was the ""sleaze-bag"" lawyer. He was a total con artist from the beginning.Spoiler Alert:The mystery was a total surprise at the end, although they didn't give the clue until half way through the final episode. I found the lawyer's role (male) to be very pathetic, although all the main lead friends were cheating on their husbands it's no reason for her to assume this role as well. The lawyer convinces other not to divorce but he insists the female lead divorce her husband. He had a conflict of interest at the very beginning.  What a total loser character as he ends up with the lead female in the end. And automatically the daughter accepts.  This could have been written better into the script, the female lead could have stayed single to operate her business and keep the relationship with the lawyer professional."

The drama follows the success story as she comes back as an ex-con, and follows her dream to become an outstanding lawyer. ","Choi Ji Woo, Jang Hyun Sung, Jeon Hye Bin, Jin Kyung, Joo Jin Mo, Lee Joon",MBC,"I'm not sure what made me decide to watch this, or continue watching. I will say that the show had an odd appeal in spite of it's flaws. Part of it is a mature romance, but most of it is a light thriller revolving around a gifted paralegal who is good at getting to the bottom of a case... I guess it's pretty obvious that that is the lady with the suitcase. 

Choi Ji Woo is great as Cha Geum Joo, and I admit I have never seen her in a drama before. She was likable early on, and I liked that she was a savvy lead, not a doormat. Her acting isn't perfect however, and there are more dramatic moments where she seems to try to play cute to the camera, which didn't really work for me. Luckily for her she was cast with two attractive and talented leads. Joo Jin Mo
as Ham Bok Geo ""Hamburger"" is grown and sexy, and a great match for her. I loved their flirty moments, and chemistry, especially in the beginning, although I kept wishing they would take things up a notch. He is an absolute charmer, and he charmed me in this role, though he's another actor I've never seen before.
Then there is Lee Joon as Ma Suk Woo, who was cute perfection. He was honestly my favorite character of them all, and I think the best actor. He managed to seem innocent, yet not naive. I loved watching his chemistry with Geum Joo when they worked together, though I admit she seemed waaaaaaaaaaaay too old for him. The love triangle between these three is pretty hilarious, even if it's a little unrealistic, they pull it off well. This was the highlight of the show for me.

The rest of the show is a messy melodrama revolving around a scandal I had a hard time following, and a mystery that didn't really grab my interest, but there is a villain that is really creepy, who I wish had a better storyline and more screen time. I still managed to enjoy the court scenes, which featured a great supporting cast, even if it was pretty obvious how things would go.

Then there's Jeon Hye Bin as Park Hye Joo (who I will forever think of as Oh Hae Young) who plays the main character's complicated sister. She is really good at playing a low key b!tch, but she honestly didn't have the acting chops to pull off such a complicated role. Her acting was so bad at times she seemed to be making fun of the role. There was just not enough depth, and I think that's this show's biggest problem. The character also had a few transformations that made no sense, especially at the end, but that could have maybe been fixed with better acting too, i think. 

The show is pretty light hearted even though it deals with some very heavy themes, which I think worked against it. People treated things like going to jail, sex trafficking, being a fugitive, and even murder so lightly that I could barely take it seriously. The later episodes also focus so much on the melodrama that the show lost much of it's appeal. Still I liked watching the story unfold for some reason, and never thought about dropping it. The ending could have also been a lot better, but since the story wasn't a strong point, I'm not sure if it would have made much difference to my overall thoughts on the drama.

Overall, a pretty good cast made this show decent, and enjoyable. Like most shows it loses much of it's charm in the final episodes, but the cast made me want to stick with it. I doubt I'd watch it again, but I will miss some of the characters. I doubt this show will be high on anyone's favorite list, but I'm glad i checked it out. The fact that there are no other reviews seems so weird since I've seen much worse dramas with tons of reviews! I'd say it's the perfect ""In the meantime"" drama for those with nothing on their queue, and wiling to give it a chance."

Having watched the original show Jane the Virgin, I was, at first, a bit hesitant because I liked that. But then I thought I should check out how the Kdrama essence changes it. And I am sadly (not really) declaring that they did fail and this was entirely a horrible attempt. It was obvious to compare this with the previous but then I thought I should actually consider it as a separate show because things must have changed with given circumstances, which did happen. Either way, it did disappoint.Developed by Studio S & Lifetime and produced by Group 8, Woori the Virgin is a comedy melodrama plus partly romcom drama, adopted from the American satire telenovela Jane the Virgin. Written by Jang Ah Mi and directed by Jung Jung Hwa, the drama was broadcasted on SBS TV and internationally distributed by Viu in limited countries. Notably, this is not a remake of the original show, rather an adaptation since all the 5 seasons from have been summed into a single season. Also, the show reunites Sung Hoon and Im Soo Hyang after 6 years who, again, happen to have debuted together 11 years ago.Oh Woo Ri (Im Soo Hyang), daughter to a single mother and raised alongside her grandmother, is a woman in early 30s who has been virgin due to her religious beliefs. During a regular checkup, she gets pregnant due to medical malpractice at her OB-GYN clinic. To her surprise, the sperm owner turns out to be a man Rafael (Sung Hoon) with whom she had a momentary fling five years back. As she decides to keep the baby and the story follows the consequences and unfamiliar events she faces.Lee Kang Jae (Shin Dong Wook) is Wooris boyfriend and a detective. Other familiar faces in the story in various major roles were: Hong Eun Hee, Yun Won Kyung, Kim Soo Ro, Lee Do Yeon, Nam Mi Jung, Hong Ji Yoon, Joo Jin Mo and Yun Woon Kyung. Plot development was the entire problem with the drama. The remake was a bad idea; they could have made a story based on the concept but they went for an adaptation, making foolish decisions. The pilot episode did its job of creating an impression at the end but the episode, as its own, was not very pleasant. However, the furtherance following that and the set of events became interesting with plenty of comic elements and revelations done for the major characters. To my disappointment, it didnt last long; it seemed smooth till 5th but what happened in 6th and the way the episode ended, I was skeptical about the rest of the show, because it hadnt even reached its interval.With only the crime scandal and the main culprit left to be unveiled, everything else became stupid and not worth of watching as soon as the 7th episode started. I cant say that the mystery plot and the investigation process kept me engaged, its just I wanted to know the culprits face even when the show had already fallen through, thats it.  It kept getting stupider and logic-less towards the ending and for my habit of not being able to leave anything unfinished, I watched 7th-14th at 3x, ngl.Emphasizing on my opinion, once again, adaptation isnt an easy job as it seems. Even if the audience doesnt expect you to justify the originality, as a writer, you must be careful not to mislay the essence of whats been presented earlier, which the debutant Jang Ah Mi jakka-nim clearly failed to accomplish. First of all, the idea to adapt a 5 seasoned show was stupid to begin with; secondly, it could have simply referred to the story and created one of their own; finally, bringing all the 5 seasons into one was where they stooped to rock-bottom. With not being able to create something noteworthy in his almost 15 year caarrer, Jung Jung Hwa PD-nim has again failed to bring another drama to justice. The flow of direction was inconsistent, very much. Things like screenplay management, sound editing and screen editing might have been handled to par but the erratic pacing and irregular development come as annoyances. While the first half was smooth and worth the patience, the latter half becomes too rushed in order to include everything within the predetermined quota. Imo, they could have made to more episodes, minimizing the damage.  Composed by Choi Seung Kwon, the show has a total of 5 OSTs and my Kdrama OST Sucker heart couldnt bring itself to love any single of them. I would say Im In Love by Sin Ye Young was the only likable track which also fits to the drama. While Gosh by Jessi is a fabulous track individually, this has no particular essence to be contributed to the show. Other 3 tracks are: Sunday to Monday by Woody and Im goin crazy which has both male & female versions, sung by Kim Bum Soo & Lee Young Hyun, respectively.What I likedNothing reallyWhat I didnt like# Sung Hoons acting doesnt improve remarkably even though he has been acting for a while and his irregular casting should be the reason, but its obvious he isnt getting many offers bcs there seems no will power to improve. He could utilize his time in taking classes. (Some of yall will come at me foe this but fact never changes.)# Character arcs for many were shoddy; not even the 3 leads had anything significance. Flaws make characters realistic but for a 14 episode fictional drama there were way too many flaws, provided they didnt have a single fraction of development. In the second half, it wasnt even funny rather ridiculous. # Kang Jaes character was horribly written with no particular sense. As a cop, he didnt show any trait that would make him a good detective. The number of times he and his wit failed, implied his incompetency and also showed how incapable the police is. In short, this was so very unrealistic and had no logic.# Chemistry between the 2 possible pairs were zero. While Im Soo Hyang did click with one showing little compatibility, pairing her up with the other was so useless and was presented with clich elements as fillers only. The original show was convincing, but as the culture and essence have changed with the remake, the same felt extremely stupid here.# The illogical plot devices were irritating in the sense that they did repeat few just to stall time and match the timelines of different subplots. Then, they used some just to fill the gaps created due to the removal of major events from the original show. Finally, the way of representation was choppy.Final remarks... Overally, Woori the Virgin is not only a bad remake but also a poor quality show if you dont take the original show into consoider. I came here knowing I might get bored but the stupidity and failures have made me mad. I understand the low budget is where the problems stem from but we have seen enough such cases, where makers have aced the race despite every hurdles. Since the show has way too many cons and almost no pro, I decline to acknowledge it as an average show, even. Dont watch."

Add to that, he had the worst haircut, every time I saw him, I thought of Spock from Star Trek.  I did enjoy watching him, because there was something so endearing about him.To me, she seemed a lot older than him, but that might just be because of the way she was written.  I didn't love her character, and there were entirely too many drunk scenes, especially for such a short show.I think my favorite parts of the show were the friendships between the men, and the friendships between the women.  I could feel their bonds, and they were very supportive, unlike most Korean dramas which always have the mean girl or the psycho guy.I found the music irritating in the fact that there was one song that was played over and over again.The ending was pretty abrupt.I really enjoyed watching the parts with the dating doctor.

I would be lying if I said I did not have a fun time watching. So Hee was as unique as always, Ji Yeon as crazy and Ji Gu as grumpy. Their friendship was still the best and strongest part of the whole show (till one specific scene). Compared to season one, it also focused on them outside of their friendship, so weve got less group drinking moments, but instead could see them interact with other people more. One thing I liked was the fact Kang Buk Gu did not really feel like the main character. I dont think he had more scenes or importance than for example Kim Sun Jong, which I dont complain about since he was never a character I looked for while watching the episodes even in season 1. It might be something that others dislike though.The issue I had with this season is how disjointed it felt. First two episodes dont fit into the timeline at all and while I understand they had to give a proper closure to the events from season 1, I am not sure they handled it in the best way storytelling wise. And the similar individual stories not quite connecting together feeling lasted for the whole duration of the show. Some episodes were truly great, some were nice, some were not memorable at all. The quality fluctuated a lot. As a whole it was less funny, less moving and less entertaining. Its still a great drama though, far above the majority of comedy shows. It just pales in comparison to season 1. The arc this time was them as individual people learning how dependable they are on each other, and how it does not always have positive effects. I understand it on paper, but I think it was not quite well presented in the show itself. Then, there was one side plotline that was the biggest issue for me. Without giving any spoilers of what happened, the events just made me question why these 3 girls are even friends and how did this friendship last so long. We got an unsatisfying conclusion to an extremely complex problem. The writing of this one side plot was so bad, I actually lost any interest in ever rewatching season 1 and 2. I just cannot see the friendship in the same light anymore (more about it in a comment below).Performances were amazing - great continuation of the phenomenal deliveries from previous season. It truly feels as if the actresses were born to take these roles. Overall, you can sense that this season is different and I think the change of the director is obvious. Personally I preferred how Kim Jung Shik handled the story. Season 1 was my first 10 in 2 years. While season 2, while I dont regret watching, I would not exactly recommend others to check out."

The dynamics between the three is a lot of fun!The male lead has a gaze that can melt any one.. he is understanding, patient, and does not exhibit a single flag... just fuzz and hoodies all around. The PPL is well incorporated and is part of the plot. The other males are there to show us how society and men often gaslight and treat woman badly... the complete opposites from mr fuzzy hoodies...

She lives with her in-laws and has cared for them. She has cooked three meals every day, looked after her three children, husband, mother in law and father law and the elders patiently. As the days pass and she is approaching the age of 60 major changes are happening which not only affect her but her family as well.PLOT VIEWThe joyous of living in a joint family. This drama has a slice of life, every plot seems felt like I have seen it in real life. While going through the journey of Hye Gyung, I thought it to be painful, but after some time I realized she chose that life. While many would think she didnt get anything in return, staying in a joint family has its perks. When Hye Gyung had problems, mother in law always gave her some meaningful advice. The children respected their family and the good upbringing showed in their behavior. Whenever the elder argued the youngster would slip out of the room. I usually 2x the speed during arguments which made the dialogues and gestures funny rather than angry like the squeaking of a squirrel.All the relationships were beautiful, but a few of my favorites were Ji sun with her father in law, Se Hee's relationship with Jae Hyun. Unlike any family, this series also Se Hyun and Se Joon as brothers had less bonding than the others. Se Hyun looks down on his brother, but still, he was not bad at heart. And Se Joon(Jung Hae In) dreams of becoming a traveler but got entwined in a romantic relationship, why was he not able to focus. Thankfully the parents understood and supported him. The cousins had friendly relationships and were always there for each other. Of course, the bad side is they sometimes get into some private matters was annoying but perks come with some disadvantages.The wide range of blind dates of Yoo So Hee was hilarious scenes.Yoo Ri was clumsy and kind but honestly, I didnt like her character, it always felt like she is faking it.The three brothers had quite a bonding, and they supported each other during the low times. That credit goes to the grandmother, Kim Sook Ja who took care of every matter positively and neatly.Hye Gyung had maintained her friendship with her friends and I liked the fact they met every month, having some good time off their routine. The only thing I didnt like about the show was getting the single ones married. Also why grandfathers wanted to live alone, during old age shouldn't they live with their children and grandchildren.The ending was fine but felt rushed, cause there were many loose bits left untied. But later on, I found that the episode was cut down by the channel.ACTING/CASTEveryone did an excellent job and I get touched with everyone.Hye Gyung (Kim Hae Sook) I had always seen her as a mother of leads, but her emotions narrated this series, which showed me a very different perspective of her. She had very simple yet powerful acting skills.Yoo Se Joon (Jung Hae In) was eye candy and being the youngest of family, he seemed troublesome but he sorted out his life diligently. he played his life character with that innocent face like a pro.I didnt like Lee Na Yeong(Nam Gyu Ri) because her laugh felt so much weird. I just ringed in the ear. I didnt like the big-mouth aunt.MUSICI didnt catch any OST if it's present,  and BGM was also minimal. I liked that there was a natural tone to the scenes. iREWATCHI would watch some of my fav scenes but watching it fully maybe not.APPRECIATIONTeaches us lots of valuable lessons about life.

Soo Ah is a very annoying character, a happy go lucky, very intrusive fan who does everything in her power to get close to Ji Hoon.She made me think of Yoko Ono and I was afraid she was going to have the same effect on the group i.e. that they would break up because of her. But their friendship was stronger than the jealousy.The music was really good here. And every episode ended with a quote from a popular rock song illustrating events in the episode. Clever!And finally, my pet peeve -HAIR: Ji Hoon's cut is just atrocious, so much so I had trouble concentrating on the drama when he was on screen!"

(sorry, I could not resist)   If you are looking for an exiting sci-fi future type thing move on there is really nothing for you to see here, as this has very little excitement in it and is pretty much guaranteed not to keep you on your toes. There is not a lot of heart fluttering moments as I would say about 90% of the mimics are listless and full of death...  Sure there are a few fluffy flash backs here and there and some pretty gorgeous scenery but if illness and death had a face this would be it. Slow, depressing and pretty much eventless, yet eventful all at once. I do not know if I am making any sense, and I am not really sure what this series is actually trying to tell us. I honestly think this is a bit like a good piece of art, up to the person watching to figure out what it truly is about, and how they feel about it. As things are never simple and always come with unforeseen consequences. Are they trying to warn people from selling their soul to google? Are they showing the us how cults work?  And warning us against mass suicide? Is it a story about religion vs. science and mans wish to believe in a life after death? Is this a blue vs. red pill situation (Matrix but without the action) Is it a depiction of the truly depressed mind? Is it truly just a solution to the overpopulated earth? A warning against euthanasia? Or is it just some person trying to exploit the weak to make money? The beauty of this show is that it had me thinking all these thoughts and more at at one point or another while showering me with beautiful cinematography. As well as with some well fitted humour, or at least scenes and dialog that I found funny, but that could be my dark and twisted humour that caught it, as this is definitely not a comedy, at all. I have one complaint and that is that I ddi not get to see enough of Han Ji Min in this as she is listed as a main but is clearly a support. So for those of you in the mood for pondering and watching something depressing, this is definitely  a good place to find it, just make sure you are up for it."

Basically, the Hanshin Hospital takes center stage. This belongs to a Jaebeol conglomerate. Yong Pal is employed here as a talented young intern. But Yong Pal also works illegally as a doctor. Provided the price is right, he treats those who need medical care below the official radar of the health care system. Yong Pal gets promoted as exclusive doctor for the discreet care of the VIPs, too. On the 12th floor, the very rich and most influential patients stay within a separate department of the Hanshin Hospital, where, in addition to plenty of luxury and discretion, only the best medical care is guaranteed. Towards the end, Yong Pal also works as a doctor in a simple, small, rural clinic. Thus, in the course of the KDrama the protagonist's field of activity (and challenges with ethics, or rather the lack of it)  covers the broad spectrum and the current focal points of the topics in health care (i.e. in South Korea).In the beginning, Yong Pal is clearly at the center of the story, captivating the audience. The focus shifts after he meets coma patient Han Yeo-jin and helps her to regain consciousness, strength and her rightful legacy as Jaebeol of the Hanshin Group. From then on, everything revolves more around Yeo-jin and her vendetta. This isn't less impressive, especially with Kim Tae-hee's intense acting. However it is different. The second part thus offers pure Korean-style Makjang: more drama is always possible. As a result, storytelling takes another lane. (Many viewers obviously don't seem to have been very happy with that. Makjang fans, however, will definitely get their money's worth.) The transition between the first and second parts is moderated by a transition, which is filled with the blossoming romance between the two protagonists. From then on, however, there is hardly any room for a love-life in the protagonist's bitter fight for inheritance and revenge, in which she is ready to take any means. (You may want to take that against the KDrama as well.)All in all, ""Yong Pal"" is a moving story that is grippingly exciting at the beginning and furthermore tells of a makjang-charged revenge. Love story included. Due to the success of the series at the time of broadcasting, actually two more episodes were added."

The story isn't the most original, but it is told in an original way to make it 'original enough'. The moral of the story was also something to appreciate. Despite a few glaring moments that were too hard to miss and ignore, acting can be considered average. Like I said, most times the three actors did their part and performed well, but there were parts that they tried hard to keep professional, but whether it was due to bad dialogue or directing, couldn't do so, and unfortunately, definitely failed. I think this is something to watch to kill time, honestly. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it's just something to watch, to kill time. If more time was allowed for the story, it could have gone either way. It had the potential to be something greater, but I could also see it nosediving into the 'terrible' category.

The story has everything I love in a drama, it had my head spinning the first few episodes with suspense making my head spin of all the theories, it tackles some of my absolute favorite issues, including child abuse, domestic violence, mental illness, suicide etc. It has some amazing friendships and relationships and even shows a person who lives with a recycled heart as a competent human being! Topped off with sweet, sweet romance, fluff and amazing side couples. This could easily have become a 10. But then, it was just dragged out,  and just turned in to a mess making me bored instead of spinning my head by the time we got to know the truth, I honestly could not have cared less.  At some point the main characters get to have conversations with their inner child, I am sorry but all respect to inner kids watching it on screen just makes me want to barf. And the monologs just never end... They try to be healing and non judgmental but end up just bad, cringey and boring. I think they try to tell us that the smallest things can make a difference but it just becomes to much...  Again sad because some parts are actually good and worth hearing, just that it gets drowned out by the moralisation, and never ending slow motion talk (okay it was not sloe mo but it felt like it) and I do not have double speed when I watch Netflix on my lap top so I endured it... But If you do not mind this stuff, go on watch it because it is pretty good between the boring parts, and hey  it also has some sweet animals in it. Now to the misinformation about heart transplants, as a  person living with a recycled heart this bugs the hell out of me, why you may ask well, I will not spoil this so Ill just say it is used in a very dehumanising way for the plot from several angels but also misinformation is bad for those who may need a heart and  those who live with a recycled heart because it effects how we are perceived and can scare the s*** out of us and people around us.  While watching I wrote this: Ok so as a heart transplantee I just have to say a few words, people who receive hearts have no time limit, we may have had before but not any more. As long as we go for regular check ups and take our meds we should be fine. We may need a kidney or liver later on but I think it is pretty rare, and my liver and kidneys are in great shape (I check them every year)!We are not restricted from exercise at all, it may take a while for the heart rate to go up but other than that we (I) should probably exercise more.We are more susceptible to infections (our meds lower our immunsystem), and skin cancer, some of us get anxiety, survivor's guilt and more often than not try to compensate for the loss of time due to previous illness by overworking and getting stress induced exhaustion...But can otherwise live perfectly boring lives, do whatever we would have done without the experience of recycling hearts...So now you get a lesson about recycling hearts, this of course goes for those with access to good health service, I also assume restrictions can very from place to place but for those wondering I take lots of meds, have a bunch of big scares (his is never visible)  and need to avoid soft ice cream and milkshakes from a machine, unpasteurised dairy, raw fish or meat, grape fruit, ice from a machine, always wash vegetables well and cut off the ends of tomatoes, avoid raw juice if it is not freshly made and need to avoid ibuprofen . I am allowed to drink alcohol in moderation unlike him, and I think that is it... So if you do chose to watch this you may want to bare this in mind..."

I want to start with the disclaimer that it's a completely personal and subjective review. For some strange reason the first two episodes just made me feel extremely uncomfortable and I cannot even explain why, but I was barely able to finish them.My biggest problem was the set up for the two main characters which led to a questionable power difference that needs good writing and enough screen time to execute well. We didn't have it here. With that, the dynamics between Shi On and Hong Seok felt off. Everything was rushed and I could not stop myself from saying: this would never ever happen in reality. This is just ridiculous.Many actions done by the characters were there simply as a lead up for cute moments and interactions or for the plot to progress, but from a logical standpoint, they should not exist. I would be lying if I said I didn't like anything about the show. Some scenes were truly adorable and I found the chemistry between the two main actors quite nice. Sadly, all of that was surrounded by too fast of a pace with not enough content to make it make sense. The plot wasn't even fast-forwarded to ridiculous speed. We literally jumped through time and space and plot points.The character that made the least sense to me was Cha Soo Ryeon. She flip-flopped and did some massive 180s here and there, and nothing was organic, cohesive and fitting the story.The acting was nice. Fanny enough, my favorite performance award goes to Lex, who played Jung Hoon - Shi On's dance classmate. The few scenes he had, he has done justice to. I also enjoyed Chu Young Woo's performance in the last episode.Overall, it's just a nonsensical show. The performances were nice, the editing was ok, but the writing and directing just left a lot to be desired. If you watch it for the two main leads and their fluffy scenes you will most likely enjoy it, but if you look for anything that has a good structure of the story and characters - this will fail your expectations."

The drama must have a big identity crises since it couldn't decide between being a family drama or makjang, constantly switching even within the same episode. Right from the beginning, EPISODE 1, when one of the family members took picture of Ji Na's necklace and, for absolutely no logical reason, put it on the internet, I could already smell the fuming hot garbage the writers are about to create. Guess what? I was 100% correct. This drama tips heavily on the baboonish side of the makjang scale.Although Uhm Jung Hwa did a great job, but it's impossible for me to view her as an evil character. I didn't like how she suddenly became evil for no reason from episode 12. We were initially presented by a strong independent Yoo Ji Na (Uhm Jung Hwa) but 15-20 episodes later the writers made her turn to a bag of dirt and completely ruined any build up she had.The drama had a strange pacing, it changes weirdly every handful of episodes with the biggest change came from switch between episodes 30 & 31 which created a big gap and disconnect in the story. Speaking of switching and change, I think the switch of the female lead ruined the drama.Jang Hee Jin is absolutely a great actress but she just didn't fit well in this case. They even went on to replace/recreate all of the flashback scenes.Another form of change/switching came with the love interest which shamelessly switched three times. It was straight up disgusting watching Hae Dang being with one man while sobbing/begging/crying/caring/dreaming/lusting/bitching/loving/chasing/pitying/thirsting/craving/running around for another man. Despicable and uncomfortable to watch! On the other spectrum, Jung Hae Jin was absolutely the only ""good"" part about this drama and nothing else.After being the nastiest humans ever to walk the earth, suddenly everyone became angelic and have the highest morale of any other human for the ending. Great writing! It feels like their budget was small, it was mostly filmed indoor between 2-3 family houses with very limited number of outdoor scenes. I feel sorry for this cast to be involved in this atrocious project. The drama that followed it after finishing serializing ""Man in the Kitchen (2017)"" was much better than this.

I could handle double amnesia -I guess? But the actions of certain characters during those times while they were needed to drag to 52 episodes sometimes  seems to not fit the characters. The characters did what they needed to do to create the drama but it made it so hard to be drawn to any character as realistic at all. Perhaps the FLs adopted mother was the only character that remained true and had growth throughout the drama. Every other character seemed to be loud and annoying with no development or a rushed abrupt turnaround (like the MLs stepmom). But I would have looked past all the flaws for the cute kids and the pretty song (veiled path) and the romance . Sadly the main couple lacked the necessary natural chemistry to provide that for me.  Their acting was fine - although  the FL spent most of her screen time crying or just smiling at the ML.and the ML spent half the time with amnesia and the other half being manipulated by the women around him.   There are probably enough good parts to take out the ridiculous parts and make a shorter and better story.  So I would have said skip through parts.  But the end  felt . Well .where did she suddenly get friends from?  We never saw them for 51 episodes ?  And the attempts to create cuteness in ep 52 . Oh my.  It failed.   If I had hopes of a wonderful final episode to save the drama I would have been disappointed.  They just threw together some ideas and created something called episode 52.

Overall, the cast was outstanding.

I watched  ""Your Playlist"" because of Sanha (Aroha here lol) and I didn't hate it but it wasn't great :/Story: The story is a bit odd to be honest... I can't share too much but the whole thing was just weird (""Big Daddy"", the main plot, etc.). It's a bit predictable and has no depth honestly. Now it's only 8 short episodes so I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but the story left a lot to be desired. Acting/Cast: They're all rookies so it's not spectacular but everybody did a good job! I think my favorite character was the main bully because she made the story more interesting lol. Music: The music was good. I don't remember any of it but it did fit the show.Rewatch Value: I wouldn't rewatch this... it wasn't interesting enough to sit through again :/Overall, it's not the worst but I wouldn't recommend it. The actors couldn't save the story either, it was just weird and the main story was bland. I rated it a 5 because I'm taking into account how short it is and the fact they are rookies.  If you're watching this for Sanha or any of the actors go ahead but I'm sure they'll have better projects in the future.Happy watching!"

I absolutely love when historical tragedies are humanized. That's what you get with ""Youth of May"". Yes, this is a love story, but more than that this is a look at a horrible moment in Korean history from the perspective of characters we grow to love through the series. Is this frustrating to watch? Yes. Is it heartbreaking? Absolutely. Is it inspiring? Also, yes. This drama does a great job of showing various perspectives, many possibly romanticized, but also relatable. I knew nothing about the Gwangju Uprising before watching and it immediately led me to want to know much more. You don't need to know the history to follow this drama, just prepare to be shocked.The story revolves around Go Min Si as Kim Myung Hee, and Lee Do Hyun as Hwang Hee Tae. It's their love story, meant only to be a brief fling,  that draws you in. Together they are super cute and have great chemistry. Myung Hee is determined to have a future in medicine while Hee Tae takes life less seriously and is more focused on a music contest than academics. Hee Tae also has serious anxiety based on past guilt and trauma, and Myung Hee has daddy issues.  These are 2 fully developed characters, and that's what made me care about them so much. Initially, their story is what you would normally expect when people from two different statuses try to date, including obligatory controlling parents, but simmering in the background there is political conflict ready to explode. Both actors were really good at keeping the romance story fresh while still handling the more painful and action-packed scenes. They are a very memorable couple.The rest of the cast is great as well. Since the point is to get to know this city I think they did a good job of giving us time to get to know everyone before the story shifts. I also liked that many of the characters are imperfect and make mistakes or become unexpected heroes throughout. Even Oh Man Suk, as the worst dad ever, didn't just feel like a caricature of a villain. This is a melodrama so some of the acting and scenes are over the top, yet it was all still completely real. Even the kids were super impressive, and I loved that they had their own part in the story as well.Would I watch this again? Yes, but next time I would love to watch knowing even more about what happened 5/18/80, what followed, and how public opinion evolved. I also would be better prepared in a rewatch for this to not just be a nostalgic romance but a real tear-jerker. It's also the perfect length for a story like this. Not too long or too short, and easy to binge.  It has a satisfying ending without being idealistic or heavy-handed, and knowing what happens doesn't ruin anything because the message at the end is so strong. I'm also sure I missed so many details.This drama also inspired me to finally watch ""A Taxi Driver"", another great perspective on the Gwangju Uprising and its victims. This drama has a similar, easily digestible, style.Overall I would definitely recommend ""Youth of May"" with the warning to know what you're getting into when watching. Its 80's nostalgia and retro romance balanced well with harsh reality, but it's not all tears. It really does aim to give honor to victims and survivors while not reducing them to only that. This isn't a drama about revolutionaries, it's a haunting look at how the revolution can come to you whether you are ready for it or not and no matter where you stand... even if all you care about is a spring fling. Gather your tissues, and prepare your heart.  ""Youth of May""  is a historical melodrama done right."

Jaechan and Munik seem like really good actors for being idols. The crying scene in episode 4 was cute. This overall was such a cute and fresh drama, I've never seen anything like it, the ending was really nice. I don't think everyone would like this type of drama, but its the only web drama I've seen that is good with it being so short i would recommend this.

After being secretly buried on a hill, Moo Young comes back to life as a zombie thanks to illegally dumped medical waste. With his memory gone, he eventually accepts reality and does whatever he can to walk and look like a human. Luckily, his peculiarly developed sense of smell allows him to position himself as one of the prominent businesses in the field of private investigation, finding the bodies of those who are reported missing.

And with that, I would definitely recommend it to people who love shows and movies with comedy as their leading genre - it was funny even for someone like me, who is not exactly a comedy fan. The jokes were rather silly, and did not need much brain power to understand, but thats what we sometimes need. Plot wise, I was slightly disappointed about the sandwich structure. The show opens with one plot, then the majority of the episodes focus on the crime mystery, to get back to the beginning plot line at the end. I would appreciate a bit more continuity - if they let Moo Young and Sun Ji investigate Moo Young's past more, as they try to solve other cases. Showing me a board with missing posters is not exactly enough. When I finally got the answers about Moo Young's story, it just did not feel connected to the previous episodes. Big props to Choi Jin Hyuk for taking a risk and picking Zombie Detective as his project. Over exaggerated and slapstick comedy were not exactly themes anyone would associate with him, and it was hard to imagine him portraying a character like Moo Young. And yet, he truly did this role justice. Sadly, while the acting was on point from the whole cast, some characters just felt redundant - the whole Sun Jis family could not exist and it would not change the plot much. Sung Rok and Wang Wey had any significance to the story only in the last act. Most of the characters outside of the mains and police were there just for the empty comedy bits. Overall, I still had quite a good time, laughed a lot and do not regret watching it. The ending might have been a bit anticlimactic but the journey made up for it."
